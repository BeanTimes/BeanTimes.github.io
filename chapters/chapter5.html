            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Dear Sofia,</p>
            <p>If I’m right, this might be the last you’ll hear from me for a while, maybe ever. Something has changed, I can feel it in my gut, and I’m beginning to worry that we may finally be in danger. It’s been two years and the Empire hasn’t told us anything about this “disease” we’re supposed to be monitoring, so now I’m more than a little excited to see what’s about to happen.</p>
            <p>I’m not sure what else to say about it. I’ve left everything I own to you, so don’t worry about what you’ll do without me. I hope Rohrdorf is still as beautiful as I remember, and I hope you’re doing well.</p>
            <p>We’ll meet again. Even if it’s in death.</p>
            <p>Barry.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Schmidt had the day off duty, so he decided to spend some time wandering Dijon. It had been two long years since Schmidt’s company was assigned to guard the village, and in that time, Schmidt had seen every centimeter of it and the surrounding countryside. Exploring the new and interesting areas of the village had long lost its appeal; there was only so much to see before it began to melt together. Dijon was starting to feel like home, and he didn’t like it.</p>
            <p>When he was first assigned, he was expecting to be put into some kind of life or death battle of the ages, where he could finally die, leave everything behind to Sofia, and be remembered as a hero of the Empire. People would tell stories of Barnabas Schmidt, the handsome legendary who sacrificed his life so that his fellow soldiers could turn the tides of battle and survive. Unfortunately, enforcing martial law on a small town in the middle of the countryside of the Kingdom of France that had already been severely weakened by some top secret disease outbreak did not offer many epic battles to die heroically in, except the occasional tavern brawl.</p>
            <p>So now, Schmidt was merely one of the soldiers that monitored the villagers. He helped with some menial tasks around the village, but on his days off there was nothing to do. He wandered the streets of Dijon, half paying attention to where he was going, half thinking about what he should do before he died. If his gut was right, everyone in Dijon would be dead within a week.</p>
            <p>If Rob was free, they could have gone to the pub together to drink. Instead, Schmidt settled on eating by himself. There was an amazing vendor that sold the best food Schmidt had ever eaten, and there was a beautiful view of the Ouche river on a hill just outside of town.</p>
            <p>As he approached the food stand, the woman monitoring the stand smiled and brought out a loaf of fresh bread and a thin slab of steamed duck meat. “Bonjour, monsieur Schmidt! Your food!” Schmidt paid for the food, thanked the kind vendor lady, and went to leave the town.</p>
            <p>Schmidt liked the kind vendor lady, but beyond his regular order from her and a few basic words they taught each other, they couldn’t communicate. Schmidt was sure she told him her name at some point, but he had forgotten, and was too afraid to ask her again for fear of insulting her. One of the many things Schmidt missed about living in the Empire was the lack of a language barrier. In Dijon, many of the civilians only knew French. Some worked to learn how to communicate with the soldiers, but many didn’t care enough to try very hard. Most of the soldiers stationed at Dijon didn’t care to learn French, either, or they weren’t smart enough to learn much, so the language barrier was very clear.</p>
            <p>While making his way to leave the city, Schmidt was so deep in thought about the kind vendor lady and his lunch that he didn’t notice a man walking in the middle of the road, who he bumped into. The man was so large that he didn’t move at all, though Schmidt was knocked back onto the hard cobblestone road, dropping his food.</p>
            <p>“NO!” Schmidt yelled. “My lunch!”</p>
            <p>“Apologies.” The man said. He was tall, easily more than 180 centimeters, and towered over Schmidt, who was now sprawled on the road. “I should have been paying more attention to where I was going. Would you like me to buy you more food?”</p>
            <p>There was a cool softness in the man’s voice. Schmidt, initially surprised by the man’s size, craned his head up to look at his face. He wore circular eyeglasses which shrouded his incredibly angry brown eyes. “No, sorry sir, I should be the one apologizing. I was too busy thinking about my lunch to pay attention to where I was going.” Schmidt just hoped the man wouldn’t report him to his superiors. Or maybe this man was one of Schmidt’s superiors. That would be even worse.</p>
            <p>“Let us agree that we were both at fault, then. I was meaning to get something to eat anyways, so please, show me where you got your food. As payment for showing me where you got your food, I will buy you some more.”</p>
            <p>Though he was still skeptical, Schmidt led the man back to the kind vendor lady’s stall. Along the way, they introduced themselves to each other. Schmidt explained that he was a soldier with the Empire, stationed at Dijon to help keep order and protect the village if need be. The man's name was Thomas Sauer, and he worked as a doctor for the government, apparently studying the disease that has been spreading through the Kingdom of France and the Spanish Empire, though Sauer himself hasn’t actually done any research regarding the actual disease. He hadn’t even seen any diseased people yet, which made him question why he was even stationed at Dijon at all.</p>
            <p>As Schmidt and Sauer walked up to the stand, the nice lady said questioningly “Bonjour encore, monsieur Schmidt. Food?” Schmidt was about to start nodding his head when Sauer replied “Oui, madame.” and proceeded to have a quick conversation with the kind vendor lady.</p>
            <p>After a few minutes, Sauer finished his conversation and paid, handing Schmidt a loaf of bread and a thicker slab of steamed duck meat than usual. “You know French?” he asked Sauer as they turned to return to the main street where they originally met.</p>
            <p>Sauer responded as they walked. “Only a little, but I have been living here for over a year now. Honestly, I am embarrassed that I do not know more.”</p>
            <p><i>Oh, I’m sure you’re embarrassed.</i> Schmidt thought. <i>’ve been here two years and I only know like, eight French words.</i> “That’s great, about the whole knowing French thing. I haven’t been able to pick up too much, I’ve been too busy with my soldier duties outside of town.”</p>
            <p>“Ah, yes, you did mention that you were a soldier before. If you do not mind me asking, what exactly do you do? And how do you feel about everything that has been going on? I think that the Empire is keeping something from us, though I have no clue what it could be. It is starting to make me anxious.”</p>
            <p>“Um, for the first part of your question, I mostly do simple tasks around town, you know, locals pay us to help move boxes around and such. Soldier work only consists of monitoring the curfew and keeping order when I’m on duty. Simple things, like breaking up tavern fights. For the second part of your question, I think that we’re all gonna die soon.”</p>
            <p>“What do you mean, exactly?”</p>
            <p>“About keeping order around town or us dying soon?”</p>
            <p>“The die soon part, why would I be asking about…”  Sauer shook his head. “Do you mean we are all going to die as in the Empire citizens, or everyone in the village?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, that, yeah, of course you wouldn’t be asking about… nevermind. Anyways, can’t you feel it? Something big’s gonna happen soon, there’s something in the air. Though, I did feel that way when I got to Dijon a few years ago, something recently has just felt wrong. I’m not too worried about dying, though.”</p>
            <p>“Well…” Sauer stopped walking in the middle of the busy main street, pausing for a little too long. Schmidt noticed that his voice was harder than it was before. “That’s certainly an interesting theory; the air is known to warn of future danger. What, exactly, do you think is going to kill us?”</p>
            <p>“I’m sure you’ve heard the rumors. Back around when Paris was attacked, there were rumors of monsters roaming the city at night, right? And then a few months later, the Empire wants to find doctors and sends them to the front lines. But, the thing is, they don’t give the doctors anything to study. The Empire tells the doctors to study a disease that doesn’t exist, and they also want the soldiers to guard French cities from an enemy that doesn’t exist. Sending doctors makes sense, in case the disease does start to spread again, but why send the soldiers?”</p>
            <p>Sauer had stopped moving at the beginning of Schmidt’s explanation, but now he looked like a statue. His eyes were scary even when he wasn’t angry, so Schmidt didn’t meet them now. Instead, he took a bite of his bread, and continued.</p>
            <p>“The soldiers are here to stop the monsters that are gonna attack. The ones that were said to roam Paris at night. I think that they’re the dead, the ones that died from the mysterious disease you’re supposed to be studying, but still moving, serving some kind of purpose after death. I think they wanna feed on the living, but that’s not the point. The point is that the Empire is scared of what happened in Paris, and doesn’t want it to spread into their territory. But they’re also scared that everyone’s gonna panic if they say outright that the dead are attacking people in the Kingdom of France.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt paused, taking another bite of his bread. He started eating the steamed duck and was surprised at how different it tasted than his regular, thinner slice. This time, Sauer replied “Do you have any evidence? Or are you just making these theories out of hearsay and rumors? The soldiers were sent to keep order in French territory, since the Kingdom has been… preoccupied recently.”</p>
            <p>“Have you heard anything from farther west from here? Paris? Madrid? Albi? All very large cities, and some haven’t said anything for two years. And that whole thing about keeping peace is just a cover to send soldiers farther west. The Empire gains nothing by keeping peace outside their territory, it would make more sense for them to wait until the cities devolved into chaos, then assume the territory as their own and reestablish order.”</p>
            <p>“What, exactly, is your point?”</p>
            <p>“First, tell me if you’ve heard anything from the west.”</p>
            <p>“What is your point.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll tell you what my point is if you answer the question.”</p>
            <p>Sauer was quiet for a moment. Schmidt thought that he was just going to walk away, leaving him standing in the street with his loaf of bread and slice of steamed duck. Schmidt tore off another piece of duck and ate it with a chunk of bread. Every bite he took, he was reminded how amazing the kind vendor lady’s food was. He’d have to thank her someday, for making living in this town bearable. Schmidt was torn from his thoughts by Sauer replying “No, I have not. I work with notable people in the Empire’s government, and I did not hear them talk about anything relating to the Spanish Empire or the Kingdom of France before I agreed to come here. Now, tell me what your point is.”</p>
            <p>“My point is that I think the disease, or the diseased, or the living dead, or whatever they are, are intelligent. I think they’re taking control of the west. The only way to leave is by boat if they cut off movement to the east, which we’re doing by stationing Empire soldiers in French territory. Now, the diseased move west, we stay in the east monitoring movement deeper into French territory, and the diseased build their army.”</p>
            <p>“If this ‘diseased army’ was attacking the peninsula, at least one person would have escaped by boat and alerted the Empire, or the British, or even the Nords or Africans. There is no way that they would silently be assimilated into some ‘disease army.’”</p>
            <p>“But, Sauer, you’re missing the most important part of the puzzle...” Schmidt paused for dramatic effect. “Intelligent disease army.”</p>
            <p>“Was this conversation going anywhere, or can I leave you with your lunch now.”</p>
            <p>“It was bold of you to assume that this conversation was ever going anywhere in the first place.”</p>
            <p>“Goodbye, Schmidt. I hope you enjoy your food. Cateline enjoys your business.”</p>
            <p>“You’ll see soon.” Schmidt said to Sauer’s back as walked back the way they came, deeper into the city. Schmidt paused for a moment, then walked the opposite direction toward the town gate, and towards his favorite spot under the tree under the hill overlooking the Ouche outside of town.</p>
            <p>As he walked, he took another bite of steamed duck wrapped around a small chunk of bread, thinking about how he would thank Cateline on his next day off. The food really was delicious. For some reason, his mind wandered to Sofia. She was probably at home today, in small, peaceful Rohrdorf, away from all the insanity here in France, and all the things that Schmidt knew were going to go wrong soon. He hoped that she would be able to live happily after he died. He knew she didn’t like it when he talked about his death, but he couldn’t help himself. He just wanted her to know that she would be safe when everything was over. He had made sure of that.</p>
            <p>“Barry!” A booming voice called from behind him, interrupting his thoughts of his sister. He turned to see a man with a silver mustache moving towards him. “Barnabas Schmidt!” Captain Humbert Bösch called after him, enunciating every syllable of his name.</p>
            <p>“No, please, anyone but him.” Schmidt muttered to himself. He wasn’t in the mood to talk to Bösch, especially after thinking about Sofia.</p>
            <p>“It’s amazing how we’re in the same company but never see each other, isn’t it Barry?” Bösch exclaimed. “It’s almost like you’re avoiding me!”</p>
            <p>“I am avoiding you.”</p>
            <p>Bösch clapped him on the back, pulling him into a hug. “Always a joker, you were, Barry! I can still remember all the amazing jokes you used to tell me when you were young… those were the days, weren’t they!”</p>
            <p>“Please, Captain, don’t call me Barry.”</p>
            <p>“Why, Barry’s an excellent nickname! You shouldn’t be ashamed of it, it really suits the man you’ve become, much better than stuffy old Barnabas!”</p>
            <p>People were beginning to stare. It was hard not to when Bösch was yelling every word. “I would just appreciate it if you didn’t call me Barry, Captain.” Schmidt said dejectedly, his voice a whisper compared to Bösch.</p>
            <p>“And there’s no need for you to call me Captain! You can just call me Uncle Humbert, like you used to! Maybe you can trick me into thinking we’re back in Rohrdorf, like the good old days! Much better than silly old Dijon!”</p>
            <p>Schmidt began to try and escape the hug Bösch still trapped him in, though he wasn’t strong enough to actually escape. “Where are you trying to go, Barry!” Schmidt considered punching him in the mustache to distract him.</p>
            <p>“It’s just, I got some food and I want to eat it before it gets cold.”</p>
            <p>“Well, I’ll come with you! We haven’t caught up with each other in---”</p>
            <p>“I’d really prefer to eat my food alone, Captain.”</p>
            <p>For a moment, Bösch’s face fell, though it returned to his normal cheery disposition less than a moment later. For that moment, Schmidt felt bad for being so rude to him, but after his face returned to normal his guilt disappeared. He hated Bösch’s cheery smile, though the mustache almost made it bearable.</p>
            <p>“Understandable.” Bösch said, the first word of the entire conversation that he spoke at a normal volume. He turned to leave, saying. “I’ll see you around the camp, then, Barry.”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, I’ll see you around...” Schmidt had to stop himself from telling Bösch not to call him Barry again. “Uncle Humbert.” He finally added.</p>
            <p>“Yes?” Bösch stopped walking away, turning back toward Schmidt.</p>
            <p>“Oh, uh, no, I just said I’ll see you around, Uncle Humbert.”</p>
            <p>Bösch smiled for a moment, though it wasn’t his usual, obnoxious smile. “You really have grown into a fine young man, Barry. Your mother would be proud.”</p>
            <p>“I’m sure she’s the only person that would be.”</p>
            <p>“I’m proud of you too, boy.” With that, Bösch again turned to leave. With Bösch gone, Schmidt’s mind wandered again to Sofia. The captain would make sure she was taken care of after he died. Despite how obnoxious he was, Schmidt knew that Captain Humbert Bösch was a man of his word.</p>
