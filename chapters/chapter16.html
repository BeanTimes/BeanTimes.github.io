                For, if I leave nothing after my own death, did I ever actually live in the first place?
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Schmidt was exhausted.</p>
            <p>The survivors of Dijon had arrived in Besançon late in the night. After ten hours of anxiously walking through the quiet French countryside, they were glad to finally see the dark outline of the city appear in the distance.</p>
            <p>As they got closer, they realized the city was deserted. The gate to the city was left open, and there were no signs of a struggle as they walked through. They wandered the empty streets, keeping watch for any signs of life, when Schmidt noticed a small light at the top of a bell tower on the northwestern edge of the city.</p>
            <p>They entered the church underneath and found a small group of sleeping soldiers, with only one man awake as they entered. “Who the hell are you?” the soldier asked with a slight accent, readying his musket defensively.</p>
            <p>Bösch took a step forward, holding his hands calmly in front of him. “I am Captain Humbert Bösch. I was assigned to protect the town of Dijon, about 60 kilometers west of here. There was a… situation. And I am sure you are here because of that situation.  Though by your lack of preparedness, I assume you do not fully understand the severity of the situation you currently find yourself in.” Bösch glanced around at the sleeping soldiers, who had begun to stir from the commotion. “Who’s in charge here?”</p>
            <p>The man who had greeted them stood to attention. “I am, Captain. Lieutenant Raphael Kaplan of the Army of the Empire, reporting.”</p>
            <p>“At rest, Lieutenant. Do you know why you and your men are stationed here?”</p>
            <p>Kaplan’s soldiers eyed the twenty survivors that had gathered just inside the entrance of the church. The only light was a candle next to Kaplan, the small flame casting dancing shadows over his face as his posture relaxed slightly. “No, Captain... I was told to look out for survivors evacuating east, though I know not why. My men have been taking shifts in the bell tower watching for survivors, though I assume the current watch is asleep due to the lack of notice of your arrival.”</p>
            <p>“Wake everyone up. Now. There’s something important we must discuss.”</p>
            <p>Kaplan ordered one of his soldiers to wake the man in the bell tower, while Bösch asked for the rest to prepare a sleeping area for the survivors. By the time Kaplan’s men returned from the bell tower’s staircase, most of the survivors had retired to the front of the nave to sleep, leaving Bösch, Schmidt, Sauer, Reist, and Rob, despite his dislocated shoulder, with Kaplan’s soldiers.</p>
            <p>Nervously, Kaplan said “This is everyone, Captain.” Despite the exhaustion of the survivors and the seriousness of Bösch’s tone, Kaplan’s soldiers didn’t seem too concerned with what Bösch was going to say. They whispered and laughed with each other behind Kaplan’s back, who did little to stop them as he eyed Bösch.</p>
            <p>“I’ve been awake for nearly twenty-four hours, so I’m going to keep this simple.” Bösch began. “Monsters attacked the town I was protecting and killed over one hundred and fifty of my men.”</p>
            <p>Bösch stopped talking. Kaplan’s men looked at each other slowly, as though they were expecting Bösch to tell them that what he said was a joke. He didn’t. Two of the soldiers tried and failed to hide their quiet laughter, which only made them laugh harder. Bösch stared at them silently, his eyes cast in shadow. A few moments of silence passed before Kaplan asked “What do you mean, monsters?”</p>
            <p>Sauer replied. “We call them Beans. Their bodies look human, though they lack facial features. They seem to have some kind of shell that is able to manipulate itself at will, which they used to massacre our soldiers. There was an… abnormal Bean that arrived much later than the regular Beans and was substantially larger, but we do not know much about it besides its attacks.”</p>
            <p>One of Kaplan’s soldiers laughed, not even attempting to hide it this time, the sound echoing eerily off of the stone walls of the church. “You can’t be serious? Beans, that’s the name you chose?” The soldier glanced at each of the survivors, and when their faces remained deadly serious, his laugh slowly died, though a slight smirk remained.</p>
            <p>Schmidt mumbled to Sauer. “I told you Beans was a stupid name.”</p>
            <p>“It felt like a good name at the time, but the more I think about it, the more I regret choosing to call them that.” Sauer replied under his breath.</p>
            <p>The soldier continued. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t laugh. This is very serious, after all. Despite the fact that what you just described sounds like a fairytale. What’s next, is a dragon going to swoop down from the sky and eat me up?” He began to laugh again.</p>
            <p>“No, a dragon isn’t going to fly down from the sky and eat any of us. But the Beans aren’t a fairytale.” Bösch pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. “Believe what you will. The last soldiers that held the same sentiment as you were ripped into pieces and scattered throughout Dijon. Not to mention the dozens of other towns that were most likely also attacked today.”</p>
            <p>The flame danced wildly on the shrinking candle.</p>
            <p>Kaplan broke the silence. “You should know that every town and city from here to the French border has been ordered to evacuate east. There are many camps like this set up north and south of here, keeping watch for survivors from the west. I know they at least go as far as Verdun and Voiron. They didn’t tell us why we were sent out, or what the survivors from the west had survived... I honestly didn’t know what to think, so we just set up here and waited... If these monsters are as powerful as you say they are, this could be very bad, couldn’t it?”</p>
            <p>Bösch nodded.</p>
            <p>“What should we do, then?”</p>
            <p>“First, I’d suggest your watchmen don't fall asleep this time.”</p>
            <p>Bösch stared at Kaplan, who stood awkwardly, staring back. After a moment, he realized Bösch was done speaking, and ordered four of his soldiers to go to the watchtower. It was obvious that some of them still didn’t believe the stories of Dijon, but Bösch’s silent glare was enough to make them do as they were told.</p>
            <p>Kaplan’s soldiers had brought more than enough bedrolls with them from Stuttgart to accommodate the survivors of Dijon. The remaining survivors spread their bedrolls through the back of the nave, while Bösch, being the captain of their company, and Reist, being the only woman of the survivors, shared a small room at the front of the nave.</p>
            <p>Rob sat on his bedroll near the entrance to the church, Sauer inspecting his injured shoulder. Earlier in the day as they rode east, Sauer and Reist had inspected the soldiers' injuries. Besides Rob, whose dislocated shoulder had to be set back into place, and Bösch, whose arms and face were peppered with dark bruises from his fights with the Beans, there were no serious injuries. Rob’s shoulder had been set back into place as they rode, and Sauer said it would be fine in a week or two with proper rest.</p>
            <p>The rest of the survivors were deep asleep now. Most of Kaplan’s soldiers had begun to take their job more seriously, with the guards posted in the bell tower watching out for advancing Beans from every direction.</p>
            <p>With a creak, the door at the front of the nave opened, Bösch walking out. He scanned the soldiers until he noticed Schmidt, who was sitting with a journal and quill writing a letter in the dim candlelight, and began to walk over to him.</p>
            <p>Bösch stood over Schmidt, who ignored him as he continued to write. After a moment, he finally asked “Barry... can I talk to you?”</p>
            <p>Schmidt looked up at him, glancing towards Rob who was occupied with Sauer, before replying “Sure, what do you want to talk about Captain?”</p>
            <p>Bösch looked at the sleeping soldiers, then at Rob. “I think it would be best if we talked privately… It’s something I don’t think you’d want the others to hear.”</p>
            <p>Apprehensively, Schmidt set his journal down. He eyed Bösch, whose face was cast in a shadow from the candle on the table. Schmidt stood up and followed him to the front of the nave. He remembered his last conversation with Bösch a few days earlier and cringed at himself, though he was too tired to come up with an excuse to avoid the conversation that was about to take place.</p>
            <p>They entered, Reist sleeping soundly on the opposite side of the room. Bösch motioned for Schmidt to close the door, and began talking as soon as he did. “I wanted to... thank you. Er, for saving me, back in Dijon. What you did was… very brave. Not just anyone would have the courage to ride back into battle, especially not against foes such as the Beans.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt stood awkwardly in front of the door. “It’s nothing, really. Those other soldiers followed me, too. One even died. I’d say that he was much braver than I was. Didn’t you see me? I was screaming like a little kid.” He let out a nervous laugh.</p>
            <p>“Yes, Barry, but you led them. You were the one that started the charge. If it wasn’t for you, I would have died.”</p>
            <p>“Sauer was preparing to go back and---”</p>
            <p>“Take the compliment, son.” Bösch interrupted, shaking his head and sighing. His tone was different now. Less uncomfortable, and much more stern. “I know it’s been hard for you, since… since your parents died. You’ve grown into a fine man, Barry. You’ve been doing an excellent job, taking care of Sofia and yourself, but I still worry about you. You think I haven’t noticed, but I have, son... I have. You’re not the same boy I knew back in Rohrdorf… You’re full of pain, sadness, fear, and you don’t know what to do with it all.”</p>
            <p>He paused for a moment. Schmidt glanced around the dark room, avoiding Bösch’s eyes. There was a desk in the center of the room, papers and books strewn across the surface. He wondered if they were Bösch’s, or some poor priest that was forced to leave his church. Bösch began to sit down on his bedroll, looking down at the floor.</p>
            <p>Schmidt opened his mouth to speak, but Bösch sighed again, cutting him off. “You’ve lost a lot, a lot more than you deserve to have lost, but you haven’t lost everything yet. Sofia will be waiting for you. She hasn’t seen you in years, and I know how worried she is about you. She writes to me, you know. I love getting her letters, and finding out how she’s been.” He paused, and Schmidt could feel his gaze through the darkness. “She’s worried about you too, maybe even more than I am. This isn’t the time for you to fight, son. Go back to your sister. She needs you.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt clenched his fists, angry that Bösch still thought he was weak. He had been given this talk from Bösch many times before, and he wasn’t going to hear it again. Not after everything he went through today, not after saving his life in some godforsaken field in the middle of France, not after watching so many people, so many innocent people, die helplessly in front of his eyes. He could still see the blood shining in the grass, the corpses flying through the air, the unnatural monsters lumbering towards him, ready to strike him down. He could still hear the muffled screams of the dying soldiers, still smell the fresh blood of the soldiers killed by the abnormal Bean monster, still feel the fear, the overwhelming fear of knowing he would die if he made one mistake, hesitated for one second too long.</p>
            <p>Bösch was right about one thing: he was scared. But that didn’t mean he had the right to lecture him about how he should help his sister, who he practically raised himself. He especially didn’t have the right to lecture him about when to give up and go home.</p>
            <p>But here they were, Bösch lecturing Schmidt in a dark room in the middle of some tiny abandoned town he didn’t even know existed, one that neither of them would ever see again.</p>
            <p>Bösch spoke just above a whisper. “Please, Barry... swallow your pride and go back to Rohrdorf. Why won’t you just let me help you? I can support you and Sofia, God knows I can, I’ve been telling you that for years. What I can’t do is keep watching you suffer like this, quiet and alone. You’re like a God damned dying animal.”</p>
            <p>The emotions that he had tried so hard to hold back the entire day came out in a flood of rage. “Like you’re one to talk about abandoning pride! You left us to go fight in your idiotic campaign! You left them to die, you know. Where were your <i>generous</i> contributions when my parents lay dying in their beds? Where were you---”</p>
            <p>“Shut the hell up.” Bösch hissed. His voice was sharp, louder than before.</p>
            <p>“---when we buried them, when Sofia wouldn’t stop crying in her bed, when---”</p>
            <p>Bösch shot up and moved towards Schmidt quicker than he would have thought possible, grabbing his shoulders and looking him directly in the eyes. He was crying. “Shut the hell up.” He said, barely above a whisper. “I know… God <i>damn it</i>, I <i>know</i>… I’ve made more than my fair share of mistakes in my life, but please, son, I’m begging you… let me do this one thing for you. You don’t have to forgive me. You don’t even have to pretend to forgive me. Just please, return to Sofia. If not for you, then for her. Barry... she needs you.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt knocked Bösch’s hands off his shoulders. “I made my decision a long time ago.” He turned towards the door, but his hand stopped at the doorknob. There was a long silence between them. Bösch stood silently, his face wet with tears. Finally, without turning, Schmidt opened the door to leave. “And don’t call me Barry.”</p>
