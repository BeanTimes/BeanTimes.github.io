            <h3>
                I realize now that I have been rambling for far too long about my own life. I am writing this journal to provide information that may be essential in defeating the Beans. If you need that information, the rest of this prologue is of no use to you; though I will summarize the most interesting characteristics of the Beans here.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>	Sauer leaned back in his chair and sighed, placing his quill on the table. The sun was setting behind Stuttgart’s walls out of the small window of his sleeping quarters behind him. He had spent his whole day inside again, and he was getting tired of it. He closed his eyes and let himself relax for a moment.</p>
            <p>The remnants of Bösch’s company arrived in Stuttgart on October 11th, six days after escaping Dijon. After their night in the uninhabited town of Besançon, Bösch had sent a messenger ahead with a detailed report of the Bean attack. As they rode farther east, the towns and cities became more and more inhabited. Far too quickly, in Bösch’s opinion. Eventually, they arrived at Stuttgart to find the gates to the city closed, and armed soldiers patrolling the eight meter tall walls.</p>
            <p>That evening, Captain Bösch met with an old friend, General Krüger. The report that had been sent from Besançon had arrived in Stuttgart a few days before the survivors of Dijon, and Krüger had taken the warning very seriously. The same report had been sent to the Holy Roman Emperor, who would soon begin setting his plan to fight against the Beans in motion.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for Sauer, the name Bean had stuck. Being used in the report sent to both General Krüger and the Emperor himself, as well as in the further explanation of events by Bösch to Krüger, the beings threatening the Empire were officially dubbed ‘Beans’. To the people who had not experienced the Beans, the name was confusing and slightly comedic. To Sauer, it was embarrassing.</p>
            <p>He had chosen the name as a joke, trying to ease the tension between himself and Schmidt on what he assumed was his last day alive. If he had thought the name out thoroughly, he would have given them a much more interesting, scientifically accurate name. However, it was too late to change it now.</p>
            <p>Bösch remained in Stuttgart, governing the city while General Krüger met with the Emperor, who was farther east with other high ranking officers and military strategists, to discuss how best to move forward. In the meantime, Schmidt, Rob, and some of the other surviving soldiers from Bösch’s company were sent back west to establish a defence against the Beans with Lieutenant Kaplan in Besançon.</p>
            <p>Before leaving Stuttgart, General Krüger had gathered doctors and scholars that had evacuated to the city to get away from the Beans, as well as volunteers, to begin studying the creatures. Their job would be to find out how to kill them and develop strategies for the Empire's army to use in battle. Sauer and Reist had been forcibly volunteered by Bösch and had spent the past three weeks poring over dozens of reports, trying to piece together how to kill the Beans.</p>
            <p>He had tried to avoid thinking about what happened in Dijon, keeping his mind occupied with his work, but he could not stop himself. Every time he closed his eyes, he could see the lifeless bodies of the soldiers sailing through the air, Wagner and Gladisch falling to the Beans. He could not stop thinking about Dijon. He had cured many patients of mania, though he was unsure how he should treat himself. Instead, he continued to try and occupy himself with work, hoping that it would go away.</p>
            <p>He thought over the report he just read, trying to find some advantage against the Beans. Something… anything.</p>
            <p>His mind wandered to Wagner, screaming hysterically as a Bean held him to the ground, its shell slowly falling towards him.</p>
            <p>Sauer swallowed, opening his eyes and turning towards the large map of western Europe that was hung over the smouldering fireplace opposite the window. There were a series of pins placed throughout the Kingdom of France in a line from north to south, signifying the places where the Beans had attacked. There were three different colors of pins each signifying a different type of Bean that had been reported.</p>
            <p>Sauer and the survivors of Dijon had only seen one type of Bean, the dark red Beans with malleable shells. Farther north, the reports of dark red Beans changed to reports of white Beans, with tougher shells that were able to deflect bullets. A report from a soldier that had escaped an attack in Reims said that the Beans had initiated the soldiers in hand to hand combat, and were easily able to subdue them. Reports from the south described the Beans as green, a group of French civilians from Valence said that they were much more agile than the other Bean types reported, though much easier to kill. Their common weakness seemed to be cannons; any Bean shot directly with a cannon was either killed or rendered no threat to humans. They had developed many theories as to why the cannons were so effective, though they were currently unable to test them, due to a lack of Beans.</p>
            <p>A second series of black pins to the east of the Bean pins signified Empire encampments established to monitor the movements of the Beans. Something that bothered Sauer was the fact that the Beans had not advanced since their coordinated surprise attack on the morning of October 5th. There had been no further sightings of Beans since, even though many of the Empire’s camps were less than a day's walk from where the Beans had initially attacked.</p>
            <p>Sauer rubbed his eyes. The sun outside had finally set, leaving the room dark besides the light from the fireplace and three lit candles. One belonged to Reist, who was reading a report from the only surviving man from Tournus, a French civilian. She had a capable mind, able to find key connections between reports, which Sauer had not known about her from their interactions in Dijon. She and Sauer had talked much more during their time in Stuttgart, though every time she spoke, her voice was soft, almost sad. She had not mentioned the man she had watched die outside of Dijon, and Sauer had not asked.</p>
            <p>The other two candles belonged to Leon Schubert, a volunteer scholar who had joined them a few weeks before. He was chosen by Bösch for his detailed background in animals, assuming it could be useful to finding weaknesses in the Beans.</p>
            <p>“Schubert.” Sauer walked behind Schubert and said simply. “Can I have one of your candles?”</p>
            <p>“Of course, Thomas my boy!” Shouted Schubert, who got up quickly from his chair. “Anything for my dearest of friends, a survivor of Dijon! It amazes me that someone with your abilities is in the same room as me. Asking for one of my candles, no less!”</p>
            <p>“I survived Dijon too.” Reist said quietly.</p>
            <p>“I know, silly, but you won’t tell me what happened!” Schubert grabbed a candle and held it out to Sauer. “Take it, my boy! It would be an honor! A survivor of Dijon, an eyewitness to the monstrous Beans! I would have fallen dead with fright if I had seen one of those hideous creatures, I would! Truly a man strong in both body and mind, you are!”</p>
            <p>Sauer sighed, taking the candle from Schubert. “Thank you, Schubert.”</p>
            <p>“Call me Leon, my boy!”</p>
            <p>“You realize I am much older than you, right? There is no need to call me boy. Please, just call me Sauer.”</p>
            <p>“I know, but I must decline!” Schubert began to take a deep breath. A wide smile began to spread across his face, his eyes fiery.</p>
            <p>Reist sighed softly, gathering her papers and standing up. “You’ve done it now, Thomas. I’ll be in the hall, come get me when he tires himself out.”</p>
            <p>“And Reist, you should call me Sauer---”</p>
            <p>Schubert cut Sauer off as Reist closed the door to the hall. “Anyways, were you not the brilliant mind who decided to call those dastardly creatures Beans? How ever did you come up with such a name? Please, tell me, Thomas my boy!”</p>
            <p>“We have been over this before, Schubert.” Sauer turned to return to his desk, placing the candle next to the reports he still needed to read. He had to force himself to steady his breathing. “Many times before, in fact. I need to get back to work, and you should too. We do not have time to waste. Otherwise, people will die.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, don’t be so dramatic and just tell me again! I just love the way you tell stories, I really do! You wouldn't want me to beg would you? I’ll beg, you know.” Schubert began to get on his knees. He had not stopped grinning.</p>
            <p>“Oh my God. Schubert, get up. Why---”</p>
            <p>“See, I knew it! A true friend like you wouldn’t make me beg to hear a story!”</p>
            <p>“Why do---”</p>
            <p>“The story, my boy! Start it before I get back on my knees!”</p>
            <p>“Fine, I will tell you the story, calm down.” Sauer was not in the mood to have a conversation with Schubert. Every time they talked, he seemed to find an excuse for him to beg for stories about Sauer’s previous failures, mostly about what had happened in Dijon. Schubert knew how much Sauer disliked the name Bean, yet he continued to ask how he came up with the name.</p>
            <p>The first evening he had joined Sauer and Reist, Schubert had asked about their experiences in Dijon. Reist gave a simple answer, avoiding any mention of the man she watched die, though Sauer explained what he saw in detail. As the evening went on, Schubert kept prodding him about why he chose the name Bean, to the point that Sauer could not handle it anymore, snapping at Schubert. He began to cry so loud that Sauer and Reist left the room. When they returned an hour later, Schubert had passed out in Sauer’s bed.</p>
            <p>Schubert was either trying very hard to provoke him, or he was shockingly socially inept. If it was the former, Sauer would have no problem telling him to shut his mouth, or simply ignore him. If it was the latter, Sauer felt bad for how easily Schubert was able to frustrate him. Unfortunately for Sauer, neither he nor Reist could decide if he was acting or not.</p>
            <p>“Actually, I will tell you after... I go to the bathroom.”</p>
            <p>“Ah, well, come back quickly, my boy!” Schubert’s grin did not fade. He watched as Sauer walked slowly to the door, expecting some resistance but receiving none, then left.</p>
            <p>Reist was sitting silently on the floor outside of their sleeping quarters, reading through the small stack of reports she brought with her by the light of a lantern on the wall.</p>
            <p>“Ah, I see you’ve finally escaped him.” Reist said without looking up from her reports. “How long was that, a minute? That has to be a new record. He didn’t even try to stop you this time.”</p>
            <p>“I do not think of myself as a violent man, but I would love to slap that insufferable grin off of his face sometimes.” Sauer said as he sat down next to Reist.</p>
            <p>“What was your excuse this time? Was it the bathroom excuse? You should really start getting more creative with them. Or just tell him how you feel.”</p>
            <p>“You feel the same way, you should tell him.”</p>
            <p>“He’s not too bad if you just ignore him. Kind of like an excitable puppy.”</p>
            <p>“He is not fascinated with you like he is with me.”</p>
            <p>“Fair point. I wonder why that is.” She had set down her reports, looking up at the ceiling while she talked.</p>
            <p>Sauer sighed. “I do not hate him or anything, I just wish he would stop asking me the same questions over and over. He is a good scholar when he is not asking me about my experiences with the Beans.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe he just <i>really</i> wants to figure out what the Beans really are and thinks you’re the key.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe...”</p>
            <p>They were silent for a moment, Sauer looking at the wall in front of him, and Reist staring up at the ceiling.</p>
            <p>Sauer broke the silence. “About what happened... outside of Dijon, I am here if you need to talk.”</p>
            <p>Reist was quiet before softly replying. “Thank you, Thomas, but I don’t feel like talking about it right now.”</p>
            <p>They were both silent again.</p>
            <p>After a few minutes of silence, Reist picked up a report and began to read it. “Do you think they’re as intelligent as humans?” She asked curtly.</p>
            <p>Sauer hesitated as he pushed the images of Dijon out of his mind. Of course, he had asked himself that question before. After seeing what they had been able to accomplish in France and witnessing the attack on Dijon first hand, it was impossible for him not to consider it. However, there were plenty of animals that were able to strategize together. He had not been able to come up with an answer he was satisfied with.</p>
            <p>The door to their sleeping quarters opened, Schubert laying out of the doorway, his head propped up with one hand. “Of course they are, silly!”</p>
            <p>“How long have you been listening?” Reist asked.</p>
            <p>“Long enough!” He winked. Somehow, it was more obnoxious than his smile. “Anyways, it’s obvious that the Beans are at least as intelligent as humans! There’s no way they would have been able to commit a coordinated assault on dozens of fortified towns spanning hundreds of kilometers if they weren’t.”</p>
            <p>Sauer said “However, that does not necessarily mean that they are intelligent. Many animals are able to coordinate similarly to the Beans.”</p>
            <p>“Trust me.” Schubert smiled. “These aren’t like any animals I’ve seen. These creatures are special. The attacks last month weren’t the beginning; they’ve been doing this for a while. There’s still the areas farther west!”</p>
            <p>“God, you remind me of someone I know.”</p>
            <p>“I’m sure I’d get along with him great!”</p>
            <p>“I’m sure you would.”</p>
            <p>“Wait,” Reist said, “what do you mean, farther west?”</p>
            <p>“There hasn’t been a single peep from Spain or France for a long time, has there? Don’t you think that the Beans had something to do with that?”</p>
            <p>Reist’s eyes narrowed. “I… hadn’t thought of that, actually.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t forget about Paris! Somehow, they were able to kill everyone without anyone outside being alerted. Must have taken a lot of brain power, much more than a simple pack hunter!” He rolled onto his back, looking at the ceiling. “Anyways, that’s just what I think! Something I’ve been wondering about is that big Bean creature, the one that destroyed the wall in Dijon! I’m sure you know the one I’m talking about! Doesn’t it bother you that there were no other reports of other abnormal creatures like that? You said it was what, six meters tall? Why do you think something like that would attack quaint little Dijon?”</p>
            <p>“I am not sure…” Sauer said.</p>
            <p>“You’re right… that’s very strange…” Reist said, picking up a report and looking through it.</p>
            <p>“Could there have been something important in Dijon? Or was it random, and we just got unlucky?” Sauer said, mostly to himself, grabbing a report from Reist’s pile.</p>
            <p>“Or maybe there were other abnormal Beans like the one in Dijon, and we were the only ones who survived?” Reist asked softly.</p>
            <p>“It’s just some food for thought, guys! No need to get so worked up over such a silly observation!” Schubert smiled, sitting up. “We should really have these workshops more often though, this is fun!”</p>
            <p>Reist ignored him. “That has to be it, we were just unlucky.”</p>
            <p>“But he does bring up a good point. How could it even get that big?” Sauer replied.</p>
            <p>“Maybe it’s just a bunch of smaller Beans grouped together to form one big Bean.”</p>
            <p>“That… could actually be plausible? Their shells were malleable, which means that it could be possible that they could group together and form a larger Bean. Maybe the other Bean types are unable to do that, due to their shells.”</p>
            <p>“What’s with those other Bean types, anyways?”</p>
            <p>Schubert spoke up. “There could be different types due to their environment.”</p>
            <p>Reist replied. “I could understand that if they were brown or grey, but red and white make no sense. Green fits that theory, though.”</p>
            <p>Sauer said. “Perhaps the color does not matter, but instead the enhanced abilities of each color?”</p>
            <p>“That makes more sense, but there are still so many other questions we can’t answer yet. Like, why do they kill people? We didn’t see them eat anyone. Do they even need to eat? We still don’t know for sure if they’re intelligent or not.” She groaned, which was very much unlike her. “And they’re relying on us to find the answers in these reports.”</p>
            <p>Sauer thought about the questions that Reist brought up. How were they going to find out more about the Beans with such little information?</p>
            <p>Schubert began to get up. “Well, that was fun! We should do this again sometime, really! Too bad we can’t do much more right now besides speculate. I’m going to bed now, good night!” He returned to their sleeping quarters.</p>
            <p>Reist sighed, gathering her reports. “We should probably go now, too. It’s cold out here.”</p>
            <p>Sauer got up with her, though he stayed silent. He was too busy thinking about the Beans.</p>
