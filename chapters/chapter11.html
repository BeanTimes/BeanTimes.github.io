            <p>Schmidt adjusted the musket in Sauer’s hands as they stood together in silence. Not only was the man incredibly opinionated, but he also couldn’t wield a musket to save his life, which could very likely lead to his death by the end of the day.</p>
            <p>Though he tried to distract himself with Sauer’s pathetic gunmanship, Schmidt’s mind wandered through the events of the last few hours. The monsters had driven them into the walls of Dijon, immediately blocking the four gates outside; too quickly, Schmidt thought, for mindless monsters. The civilians that were evacuated to the encampment outside the city had already retreated east by the time the soldiers had returned to the walls with the monsters following close behind. Schmidt assumed that Bösch had ordered the soldiers guarding the civilians to evacuate east, most likely to Stuttgart, at the first sign of danger. That, or the erratic gunfire and terrified screams of the dying soldiers scared them into retreating.</p>
            <p>The town was eerily empty with only the two hundred soldiers and several dozen civilians that were too slow to evacuate staying near the walls. Despite the panicked movement of the soldiers guarding the gates and the shots from their muskets and cannons ringing through the otherwise quiet city, Schmidt couldn’t help but feel a confusing sense of loneliness.</p>
            <p>Rob and the angry woman had left them once they got inside the town. Rob made his way towards the wall to help defend the gates, while the woman said she wanted to speak with Captain Bösch, who had headed deeper into the city to develop a strategy to fight the monsters.</p>
            <p>Schmidt had noticed how Sauer had seemingly froze in terror when they saw the monsters outside the city, and thought that it would be best to attempt to arm Sauer before the monsters entered the gates. That, and he needed something to keep himself from thinking about the monsters. If he knew the training wouldn’t help take his mind off the monsters, he would’ve found something else to do during his last hours.</p>
            <p>They stood close enough to the western gate that they could hear the monsters pounding against the gates. The sound was unusual; the monsters themselves didn’t seem very powerful, and their armor seemed soft and squishy, though they were strong enough to make the gate shutter slightly with each hit. The result of each attack was a wet slapping sound against the wood that Schmidt would have found hilarious under different circumstances.</p>
            <p>As the monsters attacked the gate, the soldiers stood on the wall, firing cannons and shooting muskets, though their attacks did very little to the slowly increasing horde of monsters. There were at least two dozen monsters attacking each of the four town gates, with many more wandering around the outside of the wall and slowly approaching from the forest in the west.</p>
            <p>The musket shots were able to eventually harm a monster if it was shot enough, and the cannons were able to severely injure the monsters in the event of a direct hit. The bad thing, however, was that most of their ammunition was sitting unused in the countryside a few miles to the west, thanks to Captain Bösch’s masterful strategy.</p>
            <p>The sudden bursts of sound from the cannons and the wet banging at the gates only drowned out the voices around him, making him feel that much more separated from everyone else around him.</p>
            <p>Sauer broke the uncomfortable silence between them, firmly stating “We should be discussing the creatures, not trying to teach me how to shoot a gun.” He let the muzzle of the musket slowly angle towards the ground again.</p>
            <p>“We should worry about getting out of here alive before we talk about those monsters.” Schmidt replied, again adjusting the musket in Sauer’s hands. At this point, the only reason he continued to help Sauer was out of a stubborn sense of annoyance at his inability to properly wield a gun. “Knowing about them won’t do you any good if you’re dead.”</p>
            <p>“Learning more about them may lead to us finding a weakness, which would help us escape with our lives.”</p>
            <p>“There’s too many of them outside. Even if we somehow find out how to kill one of them, ten more would take its place. We’re not prepared for a prolonged siege since all of our supplies are outside the town, leaving us with limited ammunition. We should be thinking about an escape, not about how to kill them.”</p>
            <p>“How do you plan to escape if you do not know anything about them?”</p>
            <p>Schmidt threw up his arms in exasperation. “How do you plan on finding a weakness? If we open the gates, we’re dead. Remember what happened to the soldiers earlier? You have no chance against them, especially if you can’t even wield a musket. You can’t get close to them, and all we can do from the walls is shoot them.”</p>
            <p>They stood in a tense silence, Sauer’s musket slowly angling back towards the ground. They glared at each other for a moment before Sauer said “What, exactly, happened to those soldiers? What are those creatures capable of, and how can we use what we know to escape the city alive?”</p>
            <p>“The monsters killed them, it’s as simple as that.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, but, <i>please</i>, just go along with me. If we just discuss what we saw, we may be able to find a weakness from what we already know.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt was beginning to get tired of being around Sauer. The wet banging at the western gate droned on. Through gritted teeth, he replied “Like I said, we should be focussing on escaping, not finding their weaknesses.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I understand that you want to escape the city.” Sauer replied, visibly annoyed now. “We can use information we already know to escape the city. This may be our best chance to discuss and learn about them, before they enter the city and kill us all. Also, we may very well be the only thing between those creatures and the more populated areas to the east.”</p>
            <p>Again, Schmidt’s mind wandered to the events of the last few hours. And, with horror, he began to think about the severity of the situation the soldiers of Dijon were actually in. The monsters had killed at least a dozen armed, experienced soldiers in a matter of minutes. What would happen when they moved past Dijon to a more populated area?</p>
            <p>What would happen to Sofia when they got to Rohrdorf?</p>
            <p>Schmidt finally replied “No need to be so dramatic.”</p>
            <p>“So, are you going to help me or not?” Sauer asked. “If you will not, I could find Gladisch or Wagner. Even that friend of yours, Rob, would do. He seemed talkative enough, though perhaps a little... slower than ideal.”</p>
            <p>They stood in silence again, the wet banging at the gates and the droning of gunfire slowly wearing down Schmidt’s sanity. As Sauer sighed and finally turned to head deeper into the city, Schmidt said “I don’t like how we don’t know how they see.”</p>
            <p>Sauer faced Schmidt again and said “Perhaps they perceive the world through touch?”</p>
            <p>“No, that doesn’t make sense. They were able to move between the trees earlier, remember? And they were able to head straight for us. They would need more than touch to do that.”</p>
            <p>“They do not have any visible sensory organs, however.”</p>
            <p>“So that’s the first big question, isn’t it? Find out how they see the world?”</p>
            <p>“Exactly. Good job, we’re <i>finally</i> getting somewhere.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt ignored the comment; it wasn’t worth his time to get into another argument. “What about their… armor, I guess. The stuff that surrounds them? They’re immune to musket shots, and we don’t have enough cannonballs to kill them all.”</p>
            <p>“They have to be weak to something, right? They are not immune to musket shots, just resistant. Clumps of their shells fall off with each shot, which means that they can be damaged. Perhaps something about the musket shots weakens their shells, something that the shots have in common with the cannonballs which the cannonballs are able to do better than the muskets?”</p>
            <p>Schmidt nodded, thinking about Sauer’s points. “Also, where did they come from? I haven’t seen much of the world, but I’m sure that those monsters aren’t anything that would be found naturally.”</p>
            <p>Sauer paused for a moment, then pulled a small journal out of his cloak’s breast pocket and began to write. “So, our questions are as follows: How do they see, how their shells work, and their origin. However, I think before we discuss those, we should discuss what to call them.”</p>
            <p>“I think ‘monster’ describes them pretty well.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe calling them ‘monsters’ is good enough for you, but I feel that giving them a name is an important first step for fighting against them.”</p>
            <p>“We don’t have time to---”</p>
            <p>“Giving them a name would make them seem more… mortal.” Sauer explained, motioning with his hands, his journal flapping wildly. “If we call them ‘monsters’, they seem unnatural, unbeatable. Giving them names makes their weaknesses, their abilities, and everything else about them easier for us to conceptualize. If we give them a name, they are no longer seemingly mythical, and therefore easier for us to discuss and plan against them.”</p>
            <p>“Fine, if you’re so fixated on a name, why don’t we just call them ‘demons’?”</p>
            <p>“Did you listen to anything I just said?”</p>
            <p>“No, I lost interest when you started talking about mortality. Your voice is very calming if you ignore the words and just listen to the sounds you make.”</p>
            <p>Sauer began tapping his foot against the cobblestone street, his eyes closed in annoyance. “Calling them ‘demons’ associates them with divinity, which would be worse for us than calling them ‘monsters’. We want a name that does not make us fear them, but instead makes them seem as little of a threat as possible.”</p>
            <p>“You got closer to them than me, did you see anything that could be useful for a name? Maybe their shells look like something stupid, and we can just name them after that.”</p>
            <p>Sauer paused, then began to write in his journal again. After a moment, he began to slow down and eventually stopped writing. He stood in silence, deep in thought.</p>
            <p>“What’s wrong?” Schmidt asked.</p>
            <p>Sauer shook his head, chuckling softly to himself. “I am sorry, but the more that I think about it, the more those monsters remind me of beans.”</p>
            <p>“Beans? You mean, like the food?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. I just thought that it was funny, connecting the two so suddenly. The thought, juxtaposed with the very real danger that---”</p>
            <p>“What kind of beans did they look like?”</p>
            <p>“They were a darker red color that I have not seen on a bean before, though their shape was reminiscent of dried field beans, of that I am certain. Their bodies seemed to be segmented in these small bean shapes, with lines of white fluid between them. I was not sure what to make of it at first, but perhaps---”</p>
            <p>“So you’re saying we should call them beans?”</p>
            <p>Sauer glared at Schmidt, or maybe that was just how his face looked. “Yes, I am suggesting that we call them Beans.”</p>
            <p>“That’s the dumbest name you could have possibly suggested.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, but would you be more apprehensive to fight a bean, or a demon?”</p>
            <p>Schmidt thought about it for a moment before replying “Alright, Beans it is. Just, if anyone else hears us calling them that, make it clear that you’re the one that came up with the name.”</p>
            <p>Sauer laughed heartily, surprising Schmidt. He didn’t realize that his shoulders were tense until Sauer’s laugh eased them a little. He was sure that he laughed to release his own tension, but Schmidt was thankful for the momentary relief from their passive aggressive conversation. Finally, Sauer wrote in his journal and replied “You have my word, I will take full responsibility for coming up with the name Bean.”</p>
            <p>“So… back to the original topic? Their origins?” Schmidt asked.</p>
            <p>“I think it would be more useful to discuss their abilities and weaknesses right now. After all, we can not learn much about their origins while we are caged within this town’s walls, and those origins might not even lead to new information.”</p>
            <p>“Good point. From what I saw before, I’m guessing that they’re able to hear somehow; they were able to move towards the sound of our gunfire. I’m not sure if they can see or not, but we shouldn’t assume that they’re blind yet, that could put us at a disadvantage. They’re also strong enough to tackle and hold down a soldier, and their armor is able to be used to suffocate a person as well as protect them from bullets. Am I missing anything?”</p>
            <p>Sauer scribbled furiously into his journal, nodding as Schmidt listed off the Beans’ abilities. “Do you think there is any significance to them suffocating soldiers?”</p>
            <p>“I mean, it’s a good way to kill them. They don’t seem to use any weapons, so that would leave punches and kicks and their only offense besides their armor. A blunt hit might wound a soldier, but it wouldn’t necessarily kill them, so they resort to using their armor.”</p>
            <p>“Interesting.” Sauer continued to write, then reviewed his notes before saying “Their coordination. That’s significant. How do they do it? They don’t seem to speak with each other.”</p>
            <p>“That weird scream at the beginning of their attack could’ve been important.”</p>
            <p>“No… no, I do not think it was. It seemed more like an intimidation tactic than any kind of strategic communication. It was too short and simple.”</p>
            <p>“Other than that, I haven’t heard any noises from them. It feels… weird, you know? Every other animal I’ve seen makes at least some noises, but the Beans are completely quiet, even when being shot at. Again, they seem weirdly unnatural.”</p>
            <p>Sauer wrote in his journal again, nodding in agreement with Schmidt’s comments. Behind him, Schmidt could hear the soldiers firing upon the monsters… the Beans… ceaselessly. He turned to face the wall, scanning the soldiers for Rob. He noticed Rob standing on the wall, who made eye contact at him and waved. Schmidt did not return the wave.</p>
            <p>The banging against the gate continued.</p>
            <p>As he continued to scan the wall, he saw the reality of the situation they were in. The soldiers, though not completely hopeless yet, had a look of desperation on their faces. After nearly an hour of retaliation, they had barely damaged the Beans’ numbers. And they were getting worried.</p>
            <p>“And what of their shells?” Sauer continued, his eyes never leaving his journal. “How do you think they are able to protect them so well?”</p>
            <p>“Look,” Schmidt began, turning back towards Sauer. Looking at the desperation on the soldier’s faces made him realize how desperate of a situation they were actually in. “I get you want to find out stuff about them, but I have no idea how they work. You got a better look at them than I did, and I’ve been standing here trying to teach you how to use a musket since we got back inside the walls, so I can’t add much more to this discussion. I think we already have enough information to plan an escape, we have a name, we know their basic abilities, and we can assume that they’re weak to guns. We should be talking about a plan now, and leave all this other stuff for after we escape. If we keep wasting time here, they’re just going to get in and slaughter us anyways. Either we’re going to discuss an escape plan---”</p>
            <p>Schmidt was cut off by the ringing of the chapel’s bell and a loud, all too familiar voice. Captain Bösch’s shout echoed through the empty stone streets. “ENEMY REINFORCEMENTS ARE ARRIVING FROM THE NORTH AND SOUTH! STAY STRONG, MEN!”</p>
