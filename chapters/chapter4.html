            <p>Sauer walked through St. Gotthard’s Chapel in the small French city of Dijon, wondering where, exactly, he had lost control of his life. He had spent a year and a half in Dijon doing absolutely nothing. When he had reluctantly agreed to go study the disease that was crippling the Kingdom of France in May of 1586, he did not expect to spend his days doing menial tasks around a sleepy village of only a few hundred.</p>
            <p>He was never one to change his mind after he set it, but when Hoffmann wanted something, his persistence was much more than Sauer could handle. He went as far as to beg Sauer during their drinking nights to head to Dijon because “These morons won’t get off my back, please Sauer, I’ll do anything.” So, Sauer made Hoffmann agree to buy his drinks when he got back to Nuremberg. For the rest of his life.</p>
            <p>Hoffmann, unable to find anyone else in Nuremberg that was willing to give up their time to work cheaply for the empire, and desperate for the Empire to leave him alone, foolishly agreed to Sauer’s conditions.</p>
            <p>But unfortunately for Sauer, today was not one of the days of the rest of his life, and he would have to wait before he massacred Hoffmann’s wallet. The Empire officials responsible for gathering the doctors and supplies that would be used to study the disease in the Kingdom of France had told him to expect to use no less than two years of his life on this project. Two years of work for unlimited drinks sounded like a good idea when he agreed.</p>
            <p>Sauer’s medical practice was a near constant reminder of how foolish he was to agree to head to Dijon, though. It would be left in the hands of his assistant, Stefan Leiner, and if it was not for the competent nurses helping run the rest of the practice, Sauer would have just closed it completely. But, like Hoffmann, the nurses were persistent. Leiner was an excellent doctor, but he was uncomfortably blunt and rude to the patients, though the nurses reassured him that they would do their best to keep as many regular patients as they could with Leiner running everything. Sometimes, when he was lost in his thoughts while doing nothing in Dijon, he would worry that there would be no medical practice in Nuremberg to return to. He would laugh at his anxiety, but in the back of his mind he knew that if anyone could destroy his life, it would be Leiner.</p>
            <p>It was not that Sauer wanted to stay in Dijon; in reality, it was the exact opposite. Multiple times, he had tried to leave. Initially he asked his supervisors, who were high ranking members of the Empire’s military, if he could return to Nuremberg because of the lack of meaningful medical work for him to do. They said no. He tried that at least once a week for the first few months before finally giving up. He even went as far as asking Captain Bösch himself, the man responsible for the Empire’s efforts in Dijon, if he could return to Nuremberg. In not so many words, Bösch refused.</p>
            <p>Around a year ago, in August of 1586, he decided to just walk away from Dijon. He would not be able to rent a horse or pay for a carriage ride out of town, since the Empire controlled all forms of travel and trade in and out of the village, but they did not control the road traffic itself, which left him with simply walking east. His reasoning was that they could not actually do anything to stop him from leaving, and once he got to another village he would arrange for travel back to Nuremberg. He was wrong.</p>
            <p>Sauer got a few kilometers away from Dijon before Empire officials found him. They rode on horseback from Dijon and, perhaps a little more forcefully than necessary, brought Sauer back to the town.</p>
            <p>The weeks following his first escape attempt, Sauer thought about different ways he could attempt to escape. Without medical work for him to do, he accepted the challenge of escaping Dijon. The plan he thought would be easiest and give him the highest chance of escape was to board a convoy of supplies heading east to Empire territory. He would simply hide inside an empty crate, then sneak out once he reached safe territory.</p>
            <p>Needless to say, he never got the chance. Sauer had finished his preparations in late November of 1586 and was days away from boarding a supply convoy when a snowstorm halted his plans. The locals had said that the past few winters had been rough for them, with snowfall beginning earlier each year without warning, devastating their crops and livestock. It was unusual for Dijon to receive a substantial amount of snow, so they were not prepared for the onslaught of the past few years. The supply convoys were unable to leave the town due to the snow, and Sauer was again stranded.</p>
            <p>By the time the snow started to melt in early February, Sauer’s spirit was already crushed. Though he desperately wanted to return to Nuremberg, he could not find the motivation to plan another elaborate escape plan. He decided to try and enjoy his time in Dijon, instead of seeking to escape.</p>
            <p>Since Sauer had arrived in Dijon, he had lived and worked in the small west wing of the local church, St. Gotthard’s Chapel, which served as the town's main hospital. The majority of Sauer’s work revolved around treating the sick and wounded French villagers and Empire soldiers. The majority of patients at the hospital had very minor injuries; light scrapes that Sauer and the other doctors would apply herbal remedies to, low fevers that they would administer medicine orally and place damp towels over the patients head, and some supernatural afflictions that Sauer would allow the priests to attend to for him. Very rarely did patients require actual treatment, or have afflictions that would impact their lives for more than a week.</p>
            <p>As he wandered the chapel, he was pulled out of his deep, rambling thoughts by a voice. “Sauer!” The voice stuttered. It belonged to Bernard Wagner, one of the doctors assigned to work in Dijon like Sauer. “Could you help us in the infirmary for a moment?”</p>
            <p>Sauer walked into the infirmary, noticing the imposing figure of Kirsa Gladisch standing behind the much smaller Wagner. Though they were hired by the Empire government to study the mysterious disease from Paris, they were under no obligation to assist St. Gotthard’s Chapel or the citizens of Dijon. Despite this, Wagner and Gladisch helped the town anyways.</p>
            <p>Wagner was chosen by the Empire because of his abilities as a brilliant, though inexperienced, doctor. He had a surprisingly vast knowledge of plants and medicinal herbs for someone so young, and he used this knowledge to help the sisters of the chapel produce medicine to aid the sick and wounded throughout the city. Gladisch was a tough, older woman who was chosen by the Empire to assist the other doctors with labor they may have been ill equipped to deal with themselves and to act as a doctor’s aid. She had spent her youth as a sister in a small chapel in the southeast Empire, where she learned much about medicine.</p>
            <p>Although a fourth and final doctor was stationed at Dijon, Sauer had not seen her much. Her name was Adaline Reist, and though she was chosen for her ability to make potent medicines, she had spent most of her time wandering around Dijon’s marketplace buying food and interacting with the locals. Sometimes, though, she would concoct medicine for especially sick patients, leaving them out for the other doctors to administer. Sauer had conflicting opinions about Reist, but decided to leave her to her own devices. After all, she was under no obligation to actually assist in anything that was not the disease from Paris. She was fully in her rights to enjoy her time in Dijon.</p>
            <p>“What the issue?” Sauer asked as he entered the infirmary with Wagner and Gladisch.</p>
            <p>“We just wanted a second opinion on this man’s wound.” Wagner said, turning his head towards a young man lying on a patient’s bed. He looked tired, and his wrist was bent at an awkward angle. “I haven’t dealt with many broken bones…”</p>
            <p>“What was your plan?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“Set the bone; give the man a splint.” Gladisch said in her usual, to the point manner.</p>
            <p>“After that?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“Would we leave him in the infirmary and keep an eye on his healing?” Wagner replied questioningly. “After we determine that he is healthy, I think we would let him leave the chapel with a splint, and tell him to be careful.”</p>
            <p>“I do not want you to ask me, Wagner, I want you to tell me.”</p>
            <p>“We will leave him in the infirmary and keep an eye on his healing.” Wagner repeated, his words more confident and his cadence quickened the second time. “After we determine he is healthy, we would let him leave the chapel with a splint, and tell him to be careful.”</p>
            <p>“Good.”</p>
            <p>“We already gave him some willow bark to chew on.” Wager added. “That should help a bit with the swelling and the pain, though there isn’t much we can do for him when we set the bone.”</p>
            <p>The man moaned next to them. Sauer replied “Yes, it sounds like you have the right idea. You are a fast learner. You will make an excellent doctor. Now, if that is all…” Sauer glanced between Wagner and Gladisch, neither of which objected, though Wagner looked slightly embarrassed. “You will do fine, Wagner. The break does not look too bad, this man should be healed before the end of October.”</p>
            <p>With that, Sauer left the infirmary to aimlessly wander the chapel again. He knew Wagner wanted to study to become a good doctor, and Sauer felt that leaving him to experience everything on his own would be the best way for him to learn. As he continued to wander the chapel again, though, he began to feel restless. There was very little to do in Dijon, and it made him anxious. He hoped he would be able to leave soon.</p>
