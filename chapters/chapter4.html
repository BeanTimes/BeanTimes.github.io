                I originally wrote this journal to catalog information about the Beans in hopes of finding a way to defeat them or, at the very least, put up the slightest semblance of a fight. Perhaps writing this now is in vain; I see no way that this journal will escape this city. However, a small part of me is compelled to write on despite the fact that my hope that humanity will survive even a decade from now has been thoroughly extinguished. Though, I do not know if I am just telling myself that so I can finally give up hope, or if I genuinely believe that this is the end.

            <p>Sauer walked through St. Gotthard’s Chapel in the small French city of Dijon, wondering where, exactly, he had lost control of his life. He had spent nearly a year in Dijon doing absolutely nothing, and it was driving him insane. When he had reluctantly agreed to go study the disease that was crippling the Kingdom of France last September, he did not expect to spend his days doing menial tasks around a sleepy village of only a few hundred.</p>
            <p>He was never one to change his mind after he set it, but when Hoffmann wanted something, his persistence was much more than Sauer could handle. He went as far as to beg Sauer during their drinking nights to head to Dijon because “These morons won’t get off my back, please Sauer, I’ll do anything.” So, Sauer made Hoffmann agree to buy his drinks when he got back to Nuremberg. For the rest of his life.</p>
            <p>Hoffmann, unable to find anyone else around Nuremberg that was willing to give up their time to work cheaply for the empire and desperate for the Empire to leave him alone, foolishly agreed to Sauer’s conditions. </p>
            <p>But unfortunately for Sauer, today was not one of the days of the rest of his life, and he would have to wait before he massacred Hoffmann’s wallet. The Empire officials bringing him to Dijon had told him to expect to spend no less than two years of his life on this project. Two years of work for unlimited drinks had sounded like a good idea when he agreed.</p>
            <p>Sauer’s medical practice was a near constant reminder of his foolishness. It was left in the hands of his assistant, Stefan Leiner, and if it was not for the nurses, Sauer would have just closed it completely. But, like Hoffmann, the nurses were persistent. Leiner was an excellent doctor, but he was uncomfortably blunt and rude to the patients. The nurses reassured him that they would be able to keep most of his regular patients with Leiner running everything, though Sauer was not sure that they could. Sometimes, when he was lost in his thoughts, he would worry that there would be no medical practice in Nuremberg to return to. He would laugh at his anxiety, but in the back of his mind he continued to worry.</p>
            <p>It was not that Sauer wanted to stay in Dijon; in reality, it was the exact opposite. Multiple times, he had tried to leave. Initially he asked his supervisors, who were members of the Empire’s military, if he could return to Nuremberg because of the lack of meaningful medical work for him to do. They told him no. He tried that at least once a week for the first few months before finally giving up. He even went as far as asking Captain Bösch himself, the man responsible for the Empire’s efforts in Dijon, if he could return to Nuremberg. In not so many words, Bösch refused.</p>
            <p>The brutal winter had come early in 1586, bringing in a large snowstorm in late November that only heightened his desire to leave Dijon. It was unusual for Dijon to receive a substantial amount of snow, so they were not prepared for the onslaught brought by the storm. The locals had said that the past few winters had been rough for them, with snowfall beginning earlier each year without warning, devastating their crops and livestock.</p>
            <p>By the time the snow finally melted in early February, Sauer’s spirit was crushed. Though he desperately wanted to return to Nuremberg, he could not find the motivation to beg Bösch to leave. He decided to try and enjoy his time in Dijon, instead of seeking to leave.</p>
            <p>Since Sauer had arrived in Dijon, he had lived and worked in the small west wing of the local church, St. Gotthard’s Chapel, which served as the town's main medical practice. The majority of Sauer’s work revolved around treating the sick and wounded French villagers and Empire soldiers. The majority of patients at the hospital had very minor injuries; light scrapes that Sauer and the other doctors would apply herbal remedies to, low fevers that they would administer medicine orally and place damp towels over the patients head, and some supernatural afflictions that Sauer would ask the sisters of the chapel to attend to for him. Very rarely did patients require actual treatment or have afflictions that would impact their lives for more than a week.</p>
            <p>As he wandered the chapel, he was pulled out of his deep, rambling thoughts by a voice. “Sauer!” the voice stuttered. It belonged to Bernard Wagner, one of the doctors assigned to work in Dijon with Sauer. “Could you help us in the infirmary for a moment?”</p>
            <p>Sauer walked into the infirmary, noticing the imposing figure of Kirsa Gladisch standing behind the much smaller Wagner. Though they were all hired by the Empire government to study the mysterious disease from Paris, they were under no obligation to assist St. Gotthard’s Chapel or the citizens of Dijon. Despite this, Wagner and Gladisch helped the town anyway. Sauer, having the most experience, only helped if the case was serious.</p>
            <p>Wagner was chosen by the Empire because of his abilities as a brilliant though inexperienced doctor. He had a surprisingly vast knowledge of plants and medicinal herbs for someone so young, and he used this knowledge to help the sisters of the chapel produce medicine to aid the sick and wounded throughout the city. Gladisch was a tough, older woman who was chosen by the Empire to assist the other doctors with labor they may have been ill equipped to deal with themselves and to act as a doctor’s aid. She had spent her youth as a sister in a small chapel in the southeast Empire, where she learned much about medicine.</p>
            <p>Although a fourth doctor was stationed at Dijon, Sauer had not seen her much. Her name was Adaline Reist, and though she was chosen for her ability to make potent medicine, she had spent most of her time wandering around Dijon’s marketplace buying food and interacting with the locals. Sometimes, though, she would concoct medicine for especially sick patients, leaving them out for the other doctors to administer. Sauer had conflicting opinions about Reist, but decided to leave her to her own devices. After all, she was fully within her rights to enjoy her time in Dijon instead of working away like Wagner and Gladisch.</p>
            <p>“What is the issue?” Sauer asked as he entered the infirmary with Wagner and Gladisch.</p>
            <p>“We just wanted a second opinion on this man’s wound,” Wagner said, turning his head towards a young man lying on a patient’s bed. He looked tired, and his wrist was bent at an awkward angle. “I haven’t dealt with many broken bones…”</p>
            <p>“What was your plan?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“Set the bone; give the man a splint,” Gladisch said in her usual, to the point manner.</p>
            <p>“After that?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“Would we leave him in the infirmary and keep an eye on his healing?” Wagner replied slowly. “After we determine that he is healthy, I think we would let him leave the chapel with a splint, and tell him to be careful.”</p>
            <p>“I do not want you to ask me, Wagner, I want you to tell me.”</p>
            <p>“We will leave him in the infirmary and keep an eye on his healing,” Wagner repeated, his words more confident and his cadence quickened the second time. “After we determine he is healthy, we would let him leave the chapel with a splint, and tell him to be careful.”</p>
            <p>“Good.”</p>
            <p>“We already gave him some willow bark to chew on,” Wagner added. “That should help a bit with the swelling and the pain, though there isn’t much we can do for him when we set the bone.”</p>
            <p>The man groaned next to them. Sauer replied “Yes, it sounds like you have the right idea. You are a fast learner. You will make an excellent doctor Wagner.” Sauer glanced between Gladisch and Wagner, who looked slightly embarrassed. “You will do fine. The break does not look too bad, this man should be healed by the end of October.”</p>
            <p>With that, Sauer left the infirmary to aimlessly wander the chapel again. He knew Wagner wanted to study to become a good doctor, and Sauer felt that leaving him to experience everything on his own would be the best way for him to learn. It was how he had learned, after all. As he continued to wander the chapel again, though, he began to feel restless. There was very little to do in Dijon, and he hoped he would be able to leave soon.</p>
