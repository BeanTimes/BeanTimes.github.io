                12pm October 5th, 1587 - Dijon, Kingdom of France
            </h2>
            <div id="div-line-long"></div>
            <h3>
                Despite everything, I still hold out hope. I wonder why that is.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Sauer stood in front of the gate.</p>
            <p>The Beans outside moved to block the soldiers from exiting Dijon as Captain Bösch smashed the barrel of his musket into the head of a Bean, sending small clumps of its shell flying as the creature fell to the ground. Bösch shouted for the soldiers to move, adjusting his grip on his weapon and motioning towards the stables in the countryside two hundred meters away from the Empire camp.</p>
            <p>Sauer watched as soldiers ran past him, directly into the horde of Beans.</p>
            <p>Beside him, Schmidt and Rob ran past, muskets aimed at two Beans approaching Bösch as he fought a third. They bickered as they shot, Schmidt’s bullet hitting one of the Beans in the shoulder, the force of the impact knocking it over, while Rob’s shot barely missed the head of the other. A third shot from a soldier behind them knocked Rob’s opponent to the ground.</p>
            <p>The Bean that Bösch had shot moments before stood up, lashing out at him despite the small crater in the center of its head. He avoided the attack, not noticing as the Bean he had just bludgeoned grabbed his leg, causing him to cry out and stumble to the ground.</p>
            <p>Soldiers and civilians ran past Bösch, attempting to avoid the Beans and reach the safety of the stables. Sauer watched as a civilian was caught by surprise as a Bean attacked him, pinning him to the ground.</p>
            <p>Schmidt sprinted over to the Bean lashing out at Bösch, hitting it in the chest with the butt of his musket. Rob ran over to help free Bösch’s leg from the grip of the second Bean, while another soldier beat the Bean’s head with the butt of his musket. Rob scraped at the Bean’s shell as if it were wet clay, though the shell was able to flow like water and cover itself again just as quickly. Slowly, beans from the shell began to move up Bösch’s leg and Rob’s arms.</p>
            <p>Rob, eyes wide, glanced between Bösch’s leg and his arms. Rob yelled something at Schmidt, who stopped beating his opponent with the butt of his musket and turned to help. Schmidt grabbed Bösch under his arms, slowly pulling his leg free of the Bean’s grip, while Rob pried his arms out. They came free of the Bean’s grip with a wet sucking noise. Shaken but unharmed, the group backed away from the four Beans advancing towards them.</p>
            <p>Bean reinforcements walked around Dijon’s wall from the north and south. Behind Sauer, Beans were beginning to enter Dijon from the destroyed section of wall, the massive Bean creature following behind, causing a rhythmic shaking with each step. Sauer estimated that they would be surrounded on all sides in less than five minutes.</p>
            <p>Still, he stood motionless inside the gate.</p>
            <p>To Sauer’s left, a young French man led Reist out of the city, hand in hand. The young man confidently held a musket, sweeping it in front of him to look for the closest opponent. Once he found his target, he shot it in the center of its featureless face. Sauer saw the bullet fly out of the other side of its head, then watched as it fell to the ground, completely motionless. Reist, who was not holding a weapon, complimented the young man, who smirked in return. Together, they ran towards the stables.</p>
            <p>Soldiers littered the ground, motionless or grasping at their throats, while others were fighting Beans and losing. A small group of soldiers gathered around Bösch, helping him and the others fight the Beans swarming around them.</p>
            <p>To Sauer’s left, Gladisch ran out of the gate, wielding a splintered piece of wood from the gate like a club. She went from fight to fight, assisting as many people as she could and directing them towards the stable.</p>
            <p>Sauer stood, frozen in fear, the ground shaking every few seconds. Thoughts flew around his head as he watched the chaos unfold in front of him. The Beans were horrifyingly durable. He should have grabbed a weapon. He should run while the Beans were distracted with the other soldiers. Why had the rhythmic shaking stopped? He should help them fight, or at least the people he cared about. Though, did he care about anyone else’s safety more than his own?</p>
            <p>What was that whistling?</p>
            <p>Beside him, there were numerous impacts in Dijon’s wall, dotting the stone with fresh craters. Sauer turned, watching the massive Bean creature slowly lower its arm from in front of it. The creature roared, causing a discomfort in Sauer’s chest, then stood motionless for another moment.</p>
            <p>The creature moved its arm back, as if to throw something. For another moment, it stood motionless. It adjusted its arm slightly. Then, its arm flew out in front of it, a cloud of the creature’s shell three meters across launched into the sky, sailing directly at him.</p>
            <p>He watched as the beans fell, first into the main street, shredding a corpse, kicking up clouds of dust, and cracking the stones with the force of the impact, then into the damaged wall to his side, which began to crumble with the new impacts. He felt the wind rush past from the force of the creature’s throw. The attack had barely missed Sauer, and the only thing between the other soldiers and the massive Bean creature had just crumbled to the ground.</p>
            <p>The Bean creature lowered its arm back down in front of it, roaring. It stopped. The creature wound its arm back again.</p>
            <p>Sauer finally ran.</p>
            <p>The situation outside the gate was not much better than inside the town. A group of soldiers had managed to slip past the Beans, making their way to the stables and preparing the horses to evacuate. Many soldiers and civilians lay dying or dead on the ground between Empire tents. Bösch, Schmidt, and Rob were standing with two other soldiers, five Beans surrounding them. Gladisch had lost her splintered piece of wood, instead resorting to her fists to fight. Reist and the young French man were fighting a Bean together, the French man smiling confidently at Reist.</p>
            <p>The massive Bean creature’s next attack hit the ground just inside the gate, a surprisingly hard bean ricocheting up and grazing Sauer’s leg, drawing blood. If he had not started running a moment earlier, he would surely have died. The massive Bean creature took another step forwards, shaking the ground.</p>
            <p>As Sauer ran, he watched the young French man drive the butt of his musket into the Bean’s chest with a wet sucking noise, the musket getting stuck in its shell. He struggled to rip the musket out of the Bean, while Reist tried to convince him to run. The young man, distracted by Reist, did not notice as the Bean lashed out, knocking him to the ground. Reist began to scream as beans from the creature’s shell were forced into the young man’s mouth, blocking his throat.</p>
            <p>In front of Sauer, Bösch’s group was having a difficult time fending off the increasing horde of Beans. He watched as a Bean lunged at Rob, who tried to dodge the attack by moving to the right. The Bean grabbed his arm, violently twisting it behind his back and throwing him to the ground. Rob shouted in pain.</p>
            <p>The other soldiers, preoccupied by their own opponents, were unable to help as Rob and the Bean rolled around on the ground, Rob only using his right arm, trying desperately to get out of the creature’s grip as he shouted in pain. Bösch was fighting two Beans at once, stabbing the barrel of his musket into their head and necks. Schmidt was wrestling the butt of his musket out of the neck of a Bean, glancing back at Rob every few moments but unable to save him. The other two soldiers were not doing much better than Schmidt, both having lost their weapons at some point in their fight, dodging the attacks from their opponents.</p>
            <p>The Bean finally pinned Rob down, his injured left arm stuck under his back at an awkward angle. Bösch and Schmidt seemed to get into an argument, both desperate but unable to help Rob escape his opponent. A clump of the Bean’s shell slowly fell towards Rob’s face. His mouth was closed, but his eyes were wide with fear as he watched the clump of beans fall slowly towards his face. Sauer assumed keeping his mouth closed would do little to stop the creature from killing him.</p>
            <p>There was a flash of movement to Sauer’s right. Gladisch sprinted towards Bösch’s struggling group. From the direction Gladisch ran from, four Beans stood over four dying soldiers that she was unable to save.</p>
            <p>The two soldiers by Bösch stood together, weaponless and afraid, in front of two Beans. As she ran past, Gladisch distracted the two Beans, giving the soldiers an opening to flee to the stables. As they fled, one of the soldiers ran too close to a Bean, and was pulled to the ground, his screams muffled as his throat was blocked. The other soldier was able to make it past safely, meeting the other survivors at the stables.</p>
            <p>Gladisch sprinted towards Rob, kicking his opponent in the chest with all of her power. The creature was knocked backwards, pulling up chunks of dirt and grass as it skidded across the ground. Gladisch picked Rob up under his arms, causing him to shout in pain, and set him on his feet. She patted him on the back and told him to run to the stables. He did.</p>
            <p>Sauer heard whistling. He did not stop to watch this time as the massive Bean creature launched more projectiles at the soldiers. There was the sound of more beans hitting a surviving section of the wall behind him, which promptly crumbled as well. There were no screams from the remaining soldiers, which relieved Sauer. He hoped they could escape before the creature was able to improve its aim.</p>
            <p>Gladisch was preparing to distract one of the Beans attacking Bösch when he commanded her to help Reist. Reist was screaming, tears flowing freely down her face, as she attempted to remove the blockage from the young man’s throat while evading the Bean that was lunging at her every few seconds. Gladisch nodded and began running towards her.</p>
            <p>Gladisch was able to reach Reist, who had been knocked to the ground by the Bean. She was flailing desperately on the ground as her opponent attempted to hold her in place. Her arms and legs flew wildly as Gladisch kicked the Bean hard in the side of the head, sending it sprawling.</p>
            <p>Schmidt had given up on his musket, leaving it sticking out of the Bean’s neck at an awkward angle. He and Bösch were having an argument as they fought, Schmidt attempting to help Bösch fight against his two opponents as he avoided the musket sticking out of his own. Their situation was not good.</p>
            <p>Schmidt, Bösch, and their two remaining Bean opponents danced around the battlefield. Bösch grabbed onto the musket sticking out of the Bean’s neck, drawing the attention of both of the creatures. He shouted something at Schmidt who shouted back angrily, then finally turned and ran towards the stables. Bösch held the barrel of the musket sticking out of the Bean in one hand, and the butt of his own musket in the other.</p>
            <p>Gladisch picked Reist up like she did Rob, placing her on her feet and telling her to run to the stables. Reist objected, again trying to run towards the body of the young man. Gladisch grabbed her by the shoulders and told her it was no use. Reist ran towards the stables in tears.</p>
            <p>Gladisch, distracted by Reist, did not notice as a Bean attacked her from behind. She was able to remain standing as the Bean grabbed onto her back, desperately trying to pull her to the ground. She steadied herself then bent forward quickly, flipping the Bean over her back with a violent shout.</p>
            <p>The creature broke apart as it flew over her head, chunks of the Bean’s shell falling onto her back. The main part of the Bean’s body that resembled a human fell on the ground in front of her, the chunks of shell that were released sticking to her upper back. The chunks of shell began to slowly move to cover her face. Panicking, Gladisch scratched at the beans, though she was unable to tear them all off. Slowly, her scratching slowed down, eventually she stopped moving altogether.</p>
            <p>The only living people remaining on the battlefield were Sauer and Bösch. The corpses of dozens of soldiers littered the ground, while only two Beans seemed to be truly dead. Sauer avoided the Beans moving towards him as he ran towards the stable. Bösch had begun to slow down, exhausted from the continuous fighting, sweat pouring down his face, though he did not give up.</p>
            <p>Sauer slowed. He glanced between Bösch and the open route to the stables. Should he help Bösch? <i>Could</i> he help Bösch? The bodies of soldiers much more capable than he lay dead on the battlefield, the remains of many more plastered throughout Dijon by the massive Bean monster. If <i>they</i> did not have a chance against the Beans, then what chance did he have? Even Bösch, seemingly the most competent soldier in Dijon, was unable to fend off the Beans for a considerable amount of time.</p>
            <p>What chance would Sauer have against them?</p>
            <p>He would have none.</p>
            <p>He gritted his teeth and continued running towards the stables.</p>
            <p>In the distance, four soldiers on horseback approached, holding farm equipment as improvised spears. They were led by Schmidt, who rode a pure white stallion, screaming. Not the confident scream of a soldier prepared for battle, but that of a scared child.</p>
            <p>Sauer slowed, watching the scene with a sense of confused awe. He knew their plan was insane, and, by the looks on their faces, they knew so too. But still, they returned to help Bösch.</p>
            <p>The four horsemen rode towards Bösch, running over the Beans in their path as they avoided the Empire tents. Sauer watched from a distance as Bösch let go of his muskets and ran away from his Bean opponents, leaving them open to be trampled by the horses.</p>
            <p>And then Sauer heard whistling.</p>
            <p>He turned back towards Dijon, seeing a cloud of beans three meters wide dotting the sky. He had a feeling that the creature would not miss this time. “Run!” Sauer shouted as Bösch jumped onto the horse with Schmidt, taking the reins from his hands. “Get out of the way!”</p>
            <p>The soldiers heeded his warning, turning their horses back towards the stables as the cloud of beans returned to the earth, as though it were a smite from God Himself. One of the soldiers was not able to escape the attack in time, his body and horse being shredded by the falling beans. He did not even have time to scream.</p>
            <p>The corpses and remaining Beans were destroyed just as mercilessly by the attack, leaving nothing but bloody grass and broken muskets in the battlefield outside the eastern gate. One of the horsemen picked up Sauer as they retreated towards the stables.</p>
            <p>As they rode, Sauer watched the remains of Dijon get farther and farther away, the massive Bean creature the new centerpiece of the town. He thought about his time there, the last year of his life. He thought of the friends he made, the people he had met that he would never see again. He thought about Gladisch sacrificing herself to save others, and Wagner, killed needlessly by the massive Bean monster. He thought about Schmidt, riding back into battle screaming like a child, and Bösch, leading his men with no regard for his own safety.</p>
            <p>And then he thought about himself.</p>
            <p>He took a deep breath and turned away from Dijon. What happened had happened. His colleagues, his friends, were dead. Countless civilians and Empire soldiers were slaughtered. Dijon was destroyed. But he was still alive, and he was going to try his best to stay that way.</p>
            <p>The remaining soldiers stood outside the stables, most holding farm equipment defensively in front of them. Besides Rob, whose injured arm was in an improvised sling, and Bösch, whose face and forearms were covered in newly forming bruises, the survivors had very little injuries.</p>
            <p>Though the Beans that were in the crossfire of the massive Bean monster’s attack were destroyed, the reinforcements that had been moving around the walls had turned to follow the survivors. They spent the next few minutes regrouping, preparing their journey back into friendly territory. Only four horses remained in the stables at the beginning of the battle, including Bösch’s own horse Pegasus, who Schmidt had ridden into battle. However, one had been killed in the skirmish to retrieve Bösch, leaving them with only three.</p>
            <p>In total, only Sauer, Bösch, Schmidt, Rob, Reist, and twenty-two other soldiers and civilians remained of the two hundred that originally prepared to fight the Beans in the countryside of Dijon only 8 hours before.</p>
            <p>Bösch and Rob rode together on Pegasus, with two people on each of the other two horses. The rest of the survivors followed on foot. It was midday, and they would be able to arrive in the French city of Besançon by nightfall.</p>
            <p>They were silent as they retreated east, the only sound being the clopping of the horses’ hooves. For once, Sauer was too tired to think.</p>
