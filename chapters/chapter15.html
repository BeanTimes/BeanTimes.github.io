                I can tell myself that my life was not a waste.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Sauer stood in front of the gate.</p>
            <p>The Beans outside moved to block the soldiers from exiting Dijon, their only deterrence being Captain Bösch, who had just smashed the barrel of his musket into the head of a Bean, sending small clumps of its shell flying as the creature fell to the ground. Bösch shouted for the soldiers to get to the stables, adjusting the grip on his weapon and motioning towards a small building that stood silently in the countryside two hundred meters down the road. </p>
            <p>Sauer watched as soldiers ran past him, directly into the horde of Beans.</p>
            <p>Beside him, Schmidt and Rob ran past, muskets aimed at two Beans approaching Bösch as he fought a third. They bickered as they shot, Schmidt’s bullet hitting one of the Beans in the arm, the force of the impact knocking it over, while Rob’s shot barely missed the head of the other. A third shot from a soldier behind them knocked Rob’s opponent to the ground.</p>
            <p>The Bean that Bösch had shot began to stand up, despite the small crater in the center of its head, and lashed out at him. Distracted, he did not notice as the Bean he had just bludgeoned with his musket grabbed his leg, causing him to cry out and stumble to the ground.</p>
            <p>Schmidt sprinted over to the Bean with the crater, hitting it in the chest with the butt of his musket. Rob ran over to help Bösch, beating the Bean’s head with his musket while another soldier tried to pry Bösch’s leg free from the creature’s grip. The soldier was able to scrape through the Bean’s shell as though it were wet clay, though the shell was able to flow like water and cover itself again just as quickly. Slowly, beans from the shell began to move up Bösch’s leg and the soldier’s arms.</p>
            <p>Rob, eyes wide, glanced between Bösch and the soldier, both of which were slowly beginning to be enveloped by beans. Rob yelled something at Schmidt, who stopped beating the Bean with the butt of his musket and turned to help. Schmidt grabbed Bösch under his arms, slowly pulling his leg free of the Bean’s grip, while Rob and the soldier swatted the beans off of his arms at the same time. Shaken but unharmed, the group backed away from the four Beans advancing towards them.</p>
            <p>Sauer noticed Bean reinforcements walking around Dijon’s wall from the north and south. Behind him, Beans were beginning to enter Dijon from the hole the massive Bean creature had made in the wall, moving carefully over the scattered debris and corpses. Sauer estimated that they would be surrounded on all sides in less than five minutes. Still, he stood motionless inside the gate.</p>
            <p>To Sauer’s left, a young French man led Reist out of the city, hand in hand. The young man confidently held his musket, sweeping it in front of him to look for the closest opponent. Once he found his target, he shot it in the center of its featureless face. Sauer saw the bullet fly out of the other side of its head, then watched as it fell to the ground, motionless, unlike the others. Reist, who was not holding a weapon, complimented the young man. Together, they ran towards the stable.</p>
            <p>More than one soldier lay on the ground, motionless or grasping at their throats, while others  were fighting Beans and losing. A small group of soldiers gathered around Bösch, helping him and the others fight the Beans swarming around them.</p>
            <p>To Sauer’s left, Gladisch ran out of the gate, wielding a splintered piece of wood from the gate like a club. Wagner followed close behind, holding his musket close to his chest as though it were a shield. Gladisch went from fight to fight, assisting as many soldiers as she could and directing them towards the stable.</p>
            <p>Sauer stood, frozen in fear, the ground shaking every few seconds. Thoughts flew around his head as he watched the chaos unfold in front of him. The Beans were horrifyingly durable. He should have grabbed a weapon. He should run while the Beans were distracted with the other soldiers. Why had the rhythmic shaking stopped? He should help them fight, or at least the people he cared about. Though, did he care about anyone else’s safety more than his own? Or anyone here, at least?</p>
            <p>What was that whistling?</p>
            <p>Beside him, there were many loud impacts in Dijon’s wall, dotting the stone with small craters. Sauer turned, watching the massive Bean creature slowly lower its arm down from in front of it. The creature roared, causing a discomfort in Sauer’s chest, then stood motionless for another moment.</p>
            <p>The creature wound its arm back, as if to throw something. For another moment, it stood motionless. It adjusted its arm slightly. Then its arm flew out in front of it, a swarm of the creature’s shell three meters across launched into the sky, sailing directly at him.</p>
            <p>He watched as the beans fell, first into the main street, shredding a corpse, kicking up clouds of dust, and cracking the stones with the force of the impact, then into the wall to his side, which began to crumble. He felt the wind rush past from the force of the creature’s throw. The attack had barely missed Sauer, and the only thing between the other soldiers and the massive Bean creature was now crumbling to the ground.</p>
            <p>The Bean creature lowered its arm back down in front of it, roaring. It stopped.</p>
            <p>The creature wound its arm back, and Sauer finally ran.</p>
            <p>The situation outside the gate was not much better than inside the city. A group of soldiers had managed to slip past the Beans, making their way to the stables and preparing the horses to evacuate. Many soldiers lay dying or dead on the ground. Bösch, Schmidt, and Rob were standing with two other soldiers, five Beans surrounding them. Gladisch had lost her splintered piece of wood, instead using her fists to fight. Wagner still clutched his musket close to his chest, shaking violently. Reist and the young French man were fighting a Bean.</p>
            <p>The massive Bean creature’s next attack hit the ground just inside the gate, a surprisingly hard bean ricocheting up and grazing Sauer’s leg, drawing blood. If he had not started running a moment earlier, he would have surely died. The massive Bean creature took another step, shaking the ground under him.</p>
            <p>As Sauer ran, he watched the young man drive the butt of his musket into the Bean’s chest with a wet sucking noise, the musket getting stuck in its shell. He struggled to rip the musket out of the Bean, while Reist tried to convince him to run. The young man, distracted by Reist, did not notice as the Bean lashed out, knocking him to the ground. Reist began to scream as beans from the creature’s shell were forced into the young man’s mouth, blocking his throat.</p>
            <p>In front of Sauer, Bösch’s group was having a difficult time fending off the increasing horde of Beans. He watched as a Bean lunged at Rob, who tried to dodge the attack by moving to the right. The Bean was able to grab his arm, violently twisting it behind his back and throwing him to the ground. Rob shouted in pain.</p>
            <p>The other soldiers, preoccupied by their own opponents, were unable to help as Rob and the Bean rolled around on the ground, Rob only using his right arm, trying desperately to get out of the creature’s grip. Bösch was fighting two Beans at once, stabbing the barrel of his musket into their head and necks. Schmidt was wrestling the butt of his musket out of the neck of a Bean, glancing back at Rob every few moments. The other two soldiers were not doing much better than Schmidt, both having lost their weapons at some point in their fight.</p>
            <p>The Bean finally pinned Rob down, his left arm stuck under his back at an awkward angle. Bösch and Schmidt seemed to get into an argument, both desperate but unable to help Rob escape his opponent. A clump of the Bean’s shell slowly fell towards Rob’s face. His mouth was closed, but his eyes were wide with fear as he watched the clump of beans fall slowly towards his face. Sauer assumed keeping his mouth closed would do little to stop the creature from killing him.</p>
            <p>There was a flash of movement to Sauer’s right. Gladisch sprinted towards Bösch’s struggling group. The only person left alive on the side of the battlefield Gladisch sprinted from was Wagner, though four Beans stood over four dying soldiers that she was unable to save.</p>
            <p>The two soldiers stood together, unmoving, weaponless, and afraid, in front of two Beans. As she ran past, Gladisch shouted at them to run towards the stables. They were finally shocked into action by her command, and made a desperate attempt to flee. They tried to run around the Beans, but one of them was too close, and was pulled to the ground, his screams muffled as his throat was blocked. The other soldier was able to make it past alive, sprinting towards the stable in the distance to meet the other survivors.</p>
            <p>Gladisch sprinted towards Rob, kicking his opponent in the chest with all of her power. The creature was knocked backwards, pulling up chunks of dirt and grass as it skidded across the ground. Gladisch picked Rob up under his arms, causing him to shout in pain, and set him on his feet. She patted him on the back and told him to get to the stables. He did.</p>
            <p>Sauer heard whistling. He did not stop to watch as the massive Bean creature launched more projectiles at the soldiers. There was the sound of more beans hitting a surviving section wall behind him, which promptly fell. There were no screams from the remaining soldiers, which relieved Sauer. He hoped they could escape before the creature was able to improve its aim.</p>
            <p>Gladisch was preparing to distract one of the Beans attacking Bösch when he commanded her to help Reist. Reist was screaming, tears flowing freely down her face, as she attempted to remove the blockage from the young man’s throat while evading the Bean that was lunging at her every few seconds. Gladisch nodded and began running towards her.</p>
            <p>Gladisch was able to reach Reist, who had finally been knocked to the ground by the Bean. She was moving around so much that her opponent was having a hard time holding her in place. Her arms and legs flailed wildly as Gladisch kicked the Bean hard in the side of the head, sending it sprawling.</p>
            <p>Schmidt had given up on his musket, leaving it sticking out of the Bean’s neck at an awkward angle. Him and Bösch were having an argument as they fought, Schmidt attempting to help Bösch fight against his two opponents as he avoided the musket sticking out of his own. Their situation did not look good.</p>
            <p>Far from battle, Wagner readied his musket, aiming it at one of the Beans bearing down on Bösch. His aim was unsteady. Schmidt, Bösch, and their three Bean opponents danced around the battlefield, the shaking barrel of Wagner’s musket barely able to keep up. He knew he only had one shot to help, one shot to help them.</p>
            <p>Bösch grabbed onto the musket sticking out of the Bean’s neck, drawing the attention of all three of the creatures. He shouted something at Schmidt who shouted back angrily, then finally turned and ran towards the stables. Bösch held the barrel of the musket sticking out of the Bean in one hand, and the butt of his own rifle in the other.</p>
            <p>A single shot rang out. One of the Beans attacking Bösch turned towards Wagner, smoke flowing out of the muzzle of his musket. It ran towards him, returning Bösch to only two opponents.</p>
            <p>Gladisch picked Reist up like she did Rob, placing her on her feet and telling her to run to the stables. Reist objected, again trying to run towards the body of the young man. Gladisch grabbed her by the shoulders and told her he was gone. Reist ran towards the stables in tears.</p>
            <p>Wagner held his rifle defensively in front of him, which did little to stop the Bean running towards him, who promptly tackled him to the ground. The creature easily held him in place, dropping a clump of its shell into his mouth. He flailed, screaming violently the whole time, though eventually fell silent.</p>
            <p>Gladisch, distracted by Reist, did not notice as the Bean attacked her from behind. She was able to remain standing as the Bean grabbed onto her back, desperately trying to pull her to the ground. She steadied herself then bent forward quickly, flipping the Bean over her back.</p>
            <p>Instead of falling onto the ground in front of her, however, parts of the creature’s shell broke off into smaller pieces, with the main part of the Bean that resembled a human body falling in front of her. The chunks of the shell that were released stuck to her upper arms and the back of her head, slowly moving to cover her face. Panicking, Gladisch scratched at the beans, though she was unable to tear them off. Slowly, her scratching slowed down, eventually she stopped moving altogether.</p>
            <p>The only living people that remained on the battlefield were Sauer and Bösch. The corpses of dozens of soldiers littered the battlefield, while only two Beans seemed to be truly dead. Sauer dodged the few Beans that attacked him as he ran past, with the rest too far away to reach him quick enough to be a threat. Bösch had begun to slow down, exhausted from the continuous fighting, sweat pouring down his face, though he did not give up.</p>
            <p>Sauer slowed. He glanced between Bösch and the open route to the stables. Should he help Bösch? <i>Could</i> he even help Bösch? The bodies of soldiers much more capable than he lay dead on the battlefield, with the remains of many more spread throughout Dijon by the massive Bean creature. If <i>they</i> did not have a chance against the Beans, then what chance did he have? Even Bösch, seemingly the most powerful soldier in Dijon, was unable to fend off the Beans for a considerable amount of time. What chance would Sauer have against them?</p>
            <p>He would have none.</p>
            <p>He gritted his teeth and continued running towards the stables, only to see three soldiers on horseback holding farm equipment as improvised spears, led by Schmidt on a pure white stallion. Schmidt was screaming, not the confident scream of a soldier prepared for battle, but that of a scared child.</p>
            <p>Sauer slowed, watching the sight with a sense of confused awe. He knew their plan was insane, and, by the looks on their faces, they knew so too. But still, they returned to help Bösch.</p>
            <p>The four horsemen rode towards Bösch, running over anything in their path. Sauer watched from a distance as Bösch let go of his muskets and ran away from his Bean opponents, leaving them open to be trampled by the horses.</p>
            <p>And then Sauer heard whistling.</p>
            <p>He turned back towards Dijon, watching as a cloud of beans three meters wide dotted the sky. He had a feeling that the creature would not miss this time. “Run!” Sauer shouted at the horsemen as Bösch jumped onto the horse with Schmidt, taking the reins. “Get out of the way!”</p>
            <p>The soldiers heeded his warning, turning their horses back towards the stable as the massive Bean creature’s attack fell, as though it was a smite from God Himself. One of the soldiers was not able to escape the attack in time, his body and horse being shredded by the falling beans. He did not even have time to scream.</p>
            <p>The corpses and remaining Beans were destroyed just as mercilessly by the attack, leaving nothing but bloody grass and broken muskets in the battlefield outside the eastern gate. One of the horsemen picked up Sauer as they retreated towards the stable.</p>
            <p>As they rode, Sauer watched the remains of Dijon get farther and farther away, the massive Bean creature the new centerpiece of the town. He thought about his time there, the last two years of his life. He thought of the friends he made, the people he had met that he would never see again. He thought of Gladisch and Wagner, sacrificing themselves to save others. He thought of Schmidt, riding back into battle screaming like a child. He thought of himself, and how he could never be as brave as them. Why was that? Could he ever be as self sacrificing as them?</p>
            <p>He took a deep breath and turned away from Dijon. What happened had happened. His colleagues were dead, the Empire’s soldiers were slaughtered, Dijon was destroyed, but he was still alive, and he was going to try his best to stay that way.</p>
            <p>The remaining soldiers stood outside the stables, most holding farm equipment defensively in front of them. Besides Rob, whose injured arm was in an improvised sling, and Bösch, whose face and forearms were covered in newly forming bruises, the surviving soldiers had very little injuries.</p>
            <p>Though the Beans that were in the crossfire of the massive Bean monster’s attack were destroyed, the reinforcements moving around the walls had already turned to follow the soldiers. They spent the next few minutes regrouping, preparing their journey back into friendly territory. Only four horses remained in the stables, including Bösch’s own horse Pegasus, who Schmidt had ridden into battle. However, one had been killed in the skirmish to retrieve Bösch, leaving them with only three horses.</p>
            <p>In total, only Sauer, Bösch, Schmidt, Rob, Reist, and twenty-two other soldiers remained of the two hundred that originally prepared to fight the Beans in the countryside of Dijon only 8 hours before. Sauer only hoped that the civilians were able to safely evacuate farther east.</p>
            <p>Bösch and Rob rode together on Pegasus, with two people on each of the other two horses. The rest of the survivors followed on foot, planning to switch at predetermined intervals. It was midday, though they would be able to arrive in the French city of Besançon by nightfall.</p>
            <p>They were silent as they retreated east, the only sound being the clopping of the horses’ hooves. For once, Sauer was too tired to think.</p>
