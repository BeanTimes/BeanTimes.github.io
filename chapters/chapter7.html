            <h3>
                The rumors spoke of monsters roaming the streets of Paris during the night. Understandably, many of us did not believe them; they seemed to be nothing more than old wives’ tales. Despite this, a small cult formed around the rumors that slowly grew in importance following the fall of Paris. Perhaps that was part of their plan, as well.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Sauer awoke to the ringing of a bell.</p>
            <p>He was sitting up before he opened his eyes. The sounds of hurried footsteps and worried voices echoed through the stone streets outside. As he opened his eyes, he realized that he was alone in the doctors’ sleeping quarters. That in and of itself was not unusual. What was unusual was that there was no hint of the sun outside.</p>
            <p>The village of Dijon was filled with torchlight and the amount of movement that would typically be reserved for hours much later after sunrise. As Sauer got out of his bed, he noticed that the other three beds in the room were all unmade. That was what concerned him the most.</p>
            <p>The dull ringing of the bell remained. There is only one bell that Sauer knew of, and that was the bell directly above him in the bell tower of St. Gotthard’s Chapel.</p>
            <p>That bell was only supposed to be rung in the event of a dire emergency.</p>
            <p>Sauer’s heart began to race, though he forced his mind not to wander. The first thing he needed to do was find out what, exactly, was going on, and why the bell was ringing.</p>
            <p>The easiest way to do that would be to ask the person ringing the bell.</p>
            <p>Sauer pushed through the door making his way to the east wing of the church, which led to the bell tower staircase. Despite the activity outside, the interior of the church was eerily empty. Only a few of the torches lining the walls were lit, whose flickering, uneven shadows attributed to the unfamiliarity of what had been his home for over a year.</p>
            <p>He made his way to the staircase uninterrupted, the bell still ringing every few seconds as he ascended two stairs at a time. As he reached the top of the stairs, Sauer could see a view of the entire area around Dijon. A line of torches dotted the countryside to the west, concentrated in a large group, where it seemed as though nearly all of the two hundred soldiers in Captain Bösch’s company stood guard. Sauer turned to the east, noticing that the Empire encampment also held smaller groups of torches which had begun to head further east.</p>
            <p>The bell was still ringing, a sister of the chapel next to it pulling the rope. Sauer motioned for her to stop ringing the bell.</p>
            <p>“Sauer? What are you still doing here?” the sister asked in a thick French accent.</p>
            <p>“What do you mean? Where am I supposed to be?” Sauer replied.</p>
            <p>“You are supposed to be over there, with the others!” the sister said, motioning to the group of torches in the west.</p>
            <p>“Sister, please, answer me plainly. What, exactly, is going on?”</p>
            <p>“Did no one tell you? About an hour ago, some Empire soldiers entered the church and told the Father to start ringing the bell, that there was an emergency. The Father then told me to ring the bell while he would help evacuate the civilians east.”</p>
            <p>“But <i>what</i> is the emergency?”</p>
            <p>“I do not know! The soldiers said something about that disease, that they needed all of the doctors to go to the west with the soldiers. I am sorry, but that is all I heard. You are going to have to go ask them yourself!” The sister returned to ringing the bell before she finished her sentence.</p>
            <p>Sauer had not even stayed long enough to hear her finish, already barreling back down the stairs and returning to the empty, cavernous nave of the church. He did not know what was going on, but he could tell that it was much more serious than a disease outbreak. Studying a disease would not require an army, after all. Certainly not a response like this. Sauer returned to his sleeping quarters, grabbing his cloak and a small journal. This would be the most opportune time for him to study… whatever was currently outside of Dijon, and he would not allow himself to miss it.</p>
            <p>For a moment, Sauer remembered the soldier he met a few days ago. The boy, Schmidt, was spouting inane conspiracy theories about the disease and the Empire. Perhaps he was onto something. Sauer certainly hoped he was not.</p>
            <p>He exited the chapel onto the main street of Dijon. Young soldiers wielding torches were guiding civilians towards the eastern gate to safety. The women looked grim, their children following, confused as to why they had been roused from their sleep so early in the morning. The men were being guided west to assist the Empire.</p>
            <p>The amount of noise this early disoriented him. Men shouted, women screamed, children cried. The crackling of torches and echoes of footfalls on the cobblestone roads reminded him far too much of Nuremberg. He noticed that his breathing had become erratic.</p>
            <p>He walked through the chaos of the main street, avoiding groups of French civilians arguing with Empire soldiers. Some men fought to stay with their families. Women carried bags of belongings, crying as they led their children away from their fathers.</p>
            <p>He arrived at the western gate, letting a group of soldiers and French men through ahead of him. Horse drawn carts made their way out of town, carrying boxes of supplies. The soldiers whispered to each other, unaware of what was going on.</p>
            <p>A minute after exiting the gate, Sauer broke into a run.</p>
            <p>As he approached the Empire’s western camp, he was astonished at the scale of the operation. Nearly all of the two hundred Empire soldiers stood, behind thirty meters of improvised defences made of wooden logs and crates, muskets held lazily at their sides. Dozens of French men littered among them, weaponless, defenceless, and confused. Even now, horses dragged logs from mills along the Ouche river to bolster the defences.</p>
            <p>A group of Empire officials stood around a map in the center of camp, which had been strewn hastily over a set of crates. Sauer spotted Wagner and Gladisch among them. As Sauer approached, he heard Wagner stutter “With all due respect, sir, if the information we have---”</p>
            <p>“I’m sorry, Bernard,” Captain Bösch said. He wore a full set of plate armor minus the helmet, his luscious silver mustache billowing slightly in the early morning breeze. “We’re continuing with the plan. The Empire has spent months preparing for this. General Krüger himself gave us the order to establish a camp west of Dijon, and I put my full faith in him.”</p>
            <p>“Excuse me,” Sauer began. “What, exactly, is the issue?”</p>
            <p>Gladisch replied curtly “This man says the diseased are going to attack us. He was instructed to shoot them; keep the civilians safe.”</p>
            <p>“The diseased?”</p>
            <p>Wagner replied “They think the diseased from Paris, the people that caught the disease we were sent to study, are attacking us for some reason. If that’s true, then we should be avoiding them, not attacking them! We’ll get sick, too!”</p>
            <p>Bösch shook his head, pinching the bridge of his nose. “We know what we’re doing. I understand how you feel, but you can trust us. My soldiers are well trained, and General Krüger has been developing this plan for some time. This is merely a precaution; we don’t want anything to happen to the civilians. If everything goes according to plan, we should be finished before lunchtime.” He sounded tired, his face taut with worry.</p>
            <p>“What do you mean <i>finished</i>?” Wagner asked. “Even if they’re trying to attack us, we can’t just kill them! They’re people too, and if the disease is making them do this, it’s not their fault!”</p>
            <p>“I agree,” Gladisch said.</p>
            <p>Wagner continued. “I promised myself that I would not let any harm befall any of my patients. I won’t break that promise for you, captain.”</p>
            <p>Bösch sighed. “I am prioritizing the civilians and my soldiers over the diseased, but don’t think I’m just going to kill everyone and call it a day, Bernard… I’m not a man who blindly follows orders. If it is possible, I will make sure the diseased are not harmed. Just, please, trust me. We have spent too much time discussing this, we must---”</p>
            <p>A commotion began to break out along the line of improvised defences. A voice rang out above the others, “Captain Bösch! Captain, the scout is coming back!”</p>
            <p>Bösch turned towards the commotion. Without another word to Sauer, Wagner, or Gladisch, he quickly made his way towards the commotion to greet the scout.</p>
            <p>“I have a bad feeling about this...” Wagner said. “Something about all this just feels wrong… I’m not sure if I can even trust the captain. They’re sick, that’s all, they don’t deserve to die...”</p>
            <p>“I agree,” Gladisch said.</p>
            <p>“Could someone tell me what his plan was?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“Well,” Wagner began, “the diseased are attacking us from the west, but they don’t know why. Captain Bösch told us that the Empire has been monitoring their activity for some time, but they kept it secret because they thought the soldiers would panic if they knew they were on the front lines of a battle.”</p>
            <p>Sauer thought of Schmidt again.</p>
            <p>Wagner continued, his stutter more prominent than usual. “Apparently, a few days ago, eastward movement was reported, but they still don’t know why. The captain got the order from General Krüger to prepare for battle out here sometime last night, and now we’re here.”</p>
            <p>The commotion along the defences slowed to a stop, though Sauer was not paying attention to it. He asked Wagner “Why would the French attack their own village?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know!” Wagner replied, throwing his hands in front of him defensively. “The captain said that a scout came back in the middle of the night and told him to prepare for an attack. That’s as far as he got before you came in and interrupted him.”</p>
            <p>“That is true,” Gladisch agreed. “I do not think the captain knows, either.”</p>
            <p>“Wait, if all of the doctors were supposed to be here, where is Reist?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“She was gone before we were alerted,” Gladisch said.</p>
            <p>“Gone? Gone where?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“We do not know,” Gladisch replied.</p>
            <p>Wagner added “It’s Reist, she probably---”</p>
            <p>A single shot rang through the countryside.</p>
            <p>Sauer, Wagner, and Gladisch paused, turning towards the direction of the shot.</p>
            <p>Silence.</p>
            <p>Then, a single wet scream that reminded Sauer of a drowning animal rang out. Then, another, and another, until a chorus of screams echoed over the dark countryside. For a terrifying moment, all he could think was they were surrounded. But then another question presented itself.</p>
            <p>Surrounded, exactly, by what?</p>
            <p>The screams slowly died out, one by one, returning the countryside to a piercing silence.</p>
            <p>“What...” Wagner stuttered. He was shaking. “What was that?”</p>
            <p>“I have never heard anything like that before,” Gladisch said. “That did not sound human.”</p>
            <p>“Are… we under attack?” Wagner asked.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, chaos erupted in the western countryside of Dijon.</p>
