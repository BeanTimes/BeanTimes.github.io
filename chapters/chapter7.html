                Now, though, I use it as a way to try and educate the survivors.

            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Sauer awoke to the ringing of a bell.</p>
            <p>He was sitting up before he opened his eyes. The sounds of hurried footsteps and worried voices echoed through the window from the stone streets outside. As he opened his eyes, he realized that he was alone in the doctors’ sleeping quarters. That in and of itself was not unusual, though. What was unusual was that there was no hint of the sun outside. Instead, the city of Dijon was filled with torchlight and the sounds of movement that would typically be reserved for hours much later after sunrise. As Sauer got out of his bed, he noticed that the other three beds throughout the room were all unmade. That was what concerned Sauer the most.</p>
            <p>The dull ringing of the bell remained. There is only one bell that Sauer knew of, and that was the bell directly above him in the bell tower of St. Gotthard’s Chapel.</p>
            <p>That bell was only supposed to be rung in the event of a dire emergency.</p>
            <p>Sauer’s heart began to race, though he forced his mind not to wander. The first thing he needed to do was find out what, exactly, was going on, why the bell was ringing.</p>
            <p>The easiest way to do that would be to ask the person ringing the bell.</p>
            <p>Sauer pushed through the door, entering the west wing of the chapel and making his way to the opposite side of the nave of the church, which led to the bell tower staircase. Despite the activity outside, the interior of the church was eerily empty. Only a few of the torches lining the wall of the church were lit, whose flickering, uneven shadows attributed to the unfamiliar eeriness of what had been Sauer’s home for over a year and a half.</p>
            <p>He made his way uninterrupted to the staircase, the bell still ringing every few seconds as he ascended two stairs at a time. As he reached the top of the stairs, Sauer could see a panoramic view of the countryside surrounding Dijon. A few kilometers in the distance to the west was a group of torches, with hundreds of what he assumed were armed Empire soldiers standing guard. Sauer turned to the east and noticed that the Empire encampment also had groups of torches, though far less than the group in the west. Turning back to the group in the west, Sauer noticed a line of torches making their way between the group of soldiers and Dijon.</p>
            <p>The bell was still ringing, with a woman next to it pulling the rope. Sauer had seen her around the chapel often, but she was nothing more than an acquaintance to him. Sauer motioned for her to stop ringing the bell.</p>
            <p>“Sauer? What are you still doing here?” the sister asked in a thick French accent.</p>
            <p>“What do you mean? Where am I supposed to be?” Sauer replied.</p>
            <p>“You are supposed to be over there!” The sister said, motioning to the group of torches in the west. “That is what you were sent here to do, after all!”</p>
            <p>“Sister, please, answer me plainly. What, exactly, is going on?”</p>
            <p>“Did no one tell you? About an hour ago, some Empire soldiers entered the church. The soldiers told the Father to start ringing the bell, and that there was an emergency. The Father then told me to come to the top of the tower and ring the bell, and that he would start evacuating the civilians east.”</p>
            <p>“But what is the emergency?”</p>
            <p>“I do not know! The soldiers said something about that disease, and that they needed all of the doctors in the chapel to go to the west with the soldiers. That is all I know, you are going to have to go ask them yourself! Excuse me, but I need to keep ringing this!”</p>
            <p>The sister had begun to ring the bell again before she finished her sentence, though Sauer had not even stayed long enough to hear her finish, already barreling back down the stairs and returning to the empty, cavernous nave of the church.</p>
            <p>Sauer did not know what was going on, but he could tell that it was very important. Studying a disease would not require an army, after all, and certainly not a response like this. Sauer returned to his sleeping quarters, grabbed his cloak and placed a set of writing instruments and a small journal in his breast pocket. This would be the most opportune time for him to study… whatever was currently attacking Dijon, and he would not allow himself to miss it.</p>
            <p>For a moment, Sauer remembered what that soldier he met a few days ago had said. The boy, Schmidt, was rambling inane conspiracy theories about the disease and the Empire, though maybe he was onto something.</p>
            <p>Sauer certainly hoped not.</p>
            <p>He exited the chapel onto the main street of Dijon. Young soldiers wielding torches were guiding civilians towards the eastern gate to safety. The children looked confused, having been roused from their sleep so early in the morning, and the women looked grim. Seeing no men, Sauer assumed their husbands had already made their way west towards the group of torches that was preparing for… something.</p>
            <p>Though there were many people moving throughout the town, there was very little noise aside from the crackling of torches and footsteps on the cobblestone roads. The western gate was open, soldiers and horse drawn carriages making their way in and out of the town. In hushed tones, soldiers talked to each other about what was going on just outside of town. He exited the gate, breaking into a run.</p>
            <p>As he approached, Sauer was astonished to see the scale of the operation. From his view in the belltower, he expected a few dozen soldiers, muskets readied and pointing west. However, nearly all of the two hundred Empire soldiers stationed at Dijon, alongside a few dozen French villagers stood behind thirty meters of improvised defences made of wooden logs and crates. Sauer could see horses coming from the mills along the Ouche river, dragging logs to be used to defend against… something.</p>
            <p>A majority of the soldiers were silently standing around the defences. Very few had their guns readied like Sauer expected, instead casually holding them, muzzles aimed towards the ground. They were silent, their eyes aimed west, their breathing shallow, waiting for the enemy.</p>
            <p>Sauer spotted Wagner and Gladisch talking hurriedly with a group of Empire officials. As Sauer approached, he heard Wagner stutter “With all due respect, sir, if the information we have---”</p>
            <p>“I’m sorry, young man.” An Empire official said. He wore a full set of plate armor minus the helmet, a luscious silver mustache extending across his face. Sauer recognized him as Captain Bösch. “We’re continuing with the plan. The Empire has spent months preparing for this. I put my faith in their plan.”</p>
            <p>“Excuse me,” Sauer began, waiting long enough for everyone to turn towards him. “What, exactly, is the issue?”</p>
            <p>Gladisch replied curtly “This man says something is coming. He wants to shoot them; keep them away from the civilians.”</p>
            <p>Wagner added “They think the disease is making them attack us. If that’s true, we should be avoiding them, not attacking them! That’s how we get sick, too!”</p>
            <p>Bösch shook his head, pinching the bridge of his nose. “We know what we’re doing. I understand how you feel, but you can trust us. My soldiers are well trained. This is merely a precaution; we don’t want anything to happen to the civilians. If everything goes according to the plan, we should be finished before lunchtime.” Bösch sounded tired, his face taut with worry.</p>
            <p>“What, exactly, is this disease?” Sauer asked. “You say that is it making someone attack us? I have never heard of such a disease.”</p>
            <p>“Yes.” Bösch sighed. “Like I told your friends, I’m only going off information the Empire gave me, but---”</p>
            <p>A commotion began to break out along the line of improvised defences. A voice rang out above the others, “Captain Bösch! Captain, the scout is coming back!”</p>
            <p>Bösch turned towards the commotion. Without a word to Sauer, Wagner, or Gladisch, he made his way towards the commotion to greet the scout.</p>
            <p>“I have a bad feeling about the captain’s plan.” Wagner said. “Something about all this just isn’t right.”</p>
            <p>“I agree.” Gladisch said.</p>
            <p>“Could someone tell me what his plan was?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“Well,” Wagner began, “apparently there’s some kind of enemy coming from the west. Captain Bösch told us that the Empire has been secretly monitoring the enemy’s activity. They kept it secret because they thought the soldiers would panic if they knew they were on the front lines of a battle.”</p>
            <p>Sauer thought of Schmidt again.</p>
            <p>Wagner continued, his stutter more prominent than usual. “Apparently, a few days ago, eastward movement was reported. The captain got the order to prepare for battle sometime last night, and now we’re here.”</p>
            <p>The commotion along the defences slowed to a stop, though Sauer was not paying attention to it. He asked Wagner “What <i>enemy</i>? The French? Why would they attack their own village?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know!” Wagner replied, throwing his hands in front of him defensively. “The captain said that a scout came back in the middle of the night and told him to prepare for something dangerous. That’s as far as he got before you came in and interrupted him.”</p>
            <p>“That is true.” Gladisch agreed. “I do not think the captain knows, either.”</p>
            <p>“Wait, if all of the doctors were supposed to be here, where is Reist?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“She was gone before we were alerted.” Gladisch said.</p>
            <p>“Gone? Gone where?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“We do not know.” Gladisch replied.</p>
            <p>“It’s Reist, she probably left town the moment she heard there was danger.” Wagner added.</p>
            <p>A single shot rang through the countryside.</p>
            <p>Sauer, Wagner, and Gladisch paused, turning towards the direction of the shot.</p>
            <p>Silence.</p>
            <p>Then, after a moment, a wet scream that reminded Sauer of a drowning animal came from what seemed like every direction. For a terrifying moment, all he could think was they were surrounded.</p>
            <p>But then another question presented itself.</p>
            <p>Surrounded, exactly, by what?</p>
            <p>The scream slowly died out.</p>
            <p>“What?” Wagner stuttered. He was shaking. “What was that?”</p>
            <p>“I have never heard anything like that before.” Gladisch said. “Is it the diseased?”</p>
            <p>Chaos erupted along the improvised defences in the western countryside of Dijon.</p>
