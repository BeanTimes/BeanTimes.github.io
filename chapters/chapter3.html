            <h3>
                Though I am staring the consequences of my actions in the face, I still can not see the point where everything went wrong. Perhaps we never did anything correctly; perhaps there was not a single point, but instead a series of miscalculations and false assumptions was what led to our downfall. Perhaps all of this was merely part of their plan, and we played right into their hands. Whatever we did wrong, wherever we screwed up, it does not matter now.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Julia Krause and her two-year-old daughter Annemarie were making their way towards the shopping district of Horb in the Holy Roman Empire. Horb wasn’t the richest area of the world, but the quaint vendors sold some of the freshest produce in the western Empire, and Krause loved them for it.</p>
            <p>Krause’s curly brown hair fluttered softly in the breeze as she held Annemarie to her chest. Her eyes sparkled with joy as she looked at Annemarie, her adorable blue eyes looking around the town excitedly.</p>
            <p>Her husband Henry was out working the fields, and would be for the rest of the day. She didn’t feel comfortable leaving Annemarie alone at their cottage, so they went to the market together. If something were to happen to her daughter, Krause wouldn’t know what to do with herself.</p>
            <p>As Krause walked down the street, she noticed a man wearing the church’s clothes, with a look in his eyes that made her uncomfortable. He was loudly preaching about gaining salvation by joining the church, and she walked hurriedly past him while his attention was on someone else. Once she was a safe distance away, she breathed a sigh of relief, glad she didn’t have to interact with the strange man.</p>
            <p>She continued walking down the main street towards the produce vendors when she heard someone in front of her call her name. “Julia!” She looked up to see her friend, Loretta Gartner, half jogging towards Krause with her arms full of bags of produce. She grinned as Loretta approached. “Jules, hello!”</p>
            <p>“Good day, Loretta,” Julia smiled, “how are you?”</p>
            <p>“I’m just excellent, I decided to buy some food to surprise George when he gets home,” Loretta replied, nodding towards the bags of produce in her arms.</p>
            <p>“I assume things with George have been going well, then?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, God yes! George has been amazing, finally getting that big oaf to marry me was the best decision of my life.”</p>
            <p>“I’m glad you’re happy. You really deserve it, Loretta.”</p>
            <p>Loretta turned slightly, attempting to hide her embarrassed smile in the crook of her shoulder. “What are you doing out today? Ever since Annemarie was born, I’ve seen so little of you. It’s been too long.”</p>
            <p>“I’m buying some produce to surprise Henry tonight, it seems we had the same idea. And this little devil has been begging me to buy her a cabbage for the past few days, so I thought I would indulge her.” At the mention of cabbage, Annemarie perked her head up and away from Krause, looking for the vegetable she desired.</p>
            <p>“Cabbage,” Annemarie beamed towards Loretta, scanning her bags of produce. Unfortunately, there was no cabbage, and she again rested her head against Krause, who felt a wave of happiness wash over her.</p>
            <p>“A fine choice, Annemarie,” Loretta replied, reaching to ruffle her hair before realizing her arms were still full. “Anyways, Jules, I just wanted to say hello when I saw you. I should head home and start preparing this food! Sorry for the interruption.”</p>
            <p>“It was no interruption, Loretta. It’s always a pleasure speaking with you.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, say hello to Henry for me,” Loretta said, waving to Krause as she walked towards the city gate.</p>
            <p>“We should get together for supper some time, you, me, Henry, and George,” Krause called towards Loretta, uncomfortable with raising her voice so loud in public.</p>
            <p>Loretta moved her arm as though she was going to wave, restrained by her produce. Instead, she turned and shouted back “Of course, how does Sunday night at my house sound?”</p>
            <p>“Good to me.”</p>
            <p>“Then it’s settled!” Loretta continued towards the city gate.</p>
            <p>Krause made her way towards the cheapest produce booths near the edge of the market. Krause had just learned a new recipe for stew that she wanted to surprise Henry with. She also wanted to get some milk to feed to Annemarie on the walk back to the cottage. Krause felt that she deserved a treat, even though she would not stop talking about cabbage.</p>
            <p>As if reading her mind, Annemarie said “Cabbage! Cabbage, cabbage!” She had become fond of the word recently, using it to describe any food she saw regardless of if it was cabbage or not. Krause wasn’t sure if Annemarie had even eaten cabbage before, though as her child’s cute little shouts began to cease, she thought about buying one.</p>
            <p>“Oh, to heck with it! I’ll buy you the best cabbage ever!” she told her daughter. By the time she had finished shopping, Krause had more than enough food for the next few days, and plenty to make her new cabbage stew for Henry. With a bag of produce and a small jar of milk held between Annemarie’s small hands, she began to make her way absentmindedly back home, loving the early autumn breeze on her face.</p>
            <p>“Excuse me, ma’am?” The preacher from earlier said, pulling her thoughts from the beautiful day. Krause looked up and saw a man slightly younger than her, no older than twenty, smiling down at her. He wore a long, brown cloak, a cross with a crescent moon shape in the middle emblazoned on the left sleeve.</p>
            <p>“What can I do for you?” Krause replied slowly. Annemarie was so overjoyed from her buying cabbage that she had fallen asleep in her arms. She tucked the small bottle of milk back in her bag, smiling at the sleeping Annemarie, avoiding eye contact with the preacher.</p>
            <p>“Do ya have a moment to talk?” There was something about his smile that Krause didn’t like.</p>
            <p>“Of course,” Krause smiled back at the man.</p>
            <p>“I’m sure ya've heard about all there ruckus in the Kingdom of France over tha past few months?”</p>
            <p>“Why, yes, it’s been the talk of the town for a while now!” Krause didn’t like how everything he said was a question, though she was too uncomfortable to walk away in the middle of their conversation.</p>
            <p>“Well, ya see, we’n think that that there ruckus is the work of God...” Krause didn’t respond this time, waiting for the man to continue himself, though she still smiled at him. “Um… and, we’n are lookin’ for people that would be intr’sted in joinin’ us worshipin’ the angel sent from on high, so that we’n may be spared, from His holy wrath!”</p>
            <p>Krause’s smile began to fade slightly, but once she noticed she began to force herself to keep her smile. There was definitely something off about this man, but now that a rapor had been established, she wouldn’t be able leave. She cursed herself for being so nice to the man. Begrudgingly, she replied “Ok, I’ll think about it. Where do you meet?”</p>
            <p>“We’n meet in the Oratory of Saint Maria, a lil’n down that away. Just go’n around there askin’ for the Church of the Beanmeister. We have a lotta people lookin’ out for new followers, they’d be glad ta lead ya ta the church.” The man pointed behind Krause, somewhere in the western portion of town.</p>
            <p>Krause was tired of smiling, though she continued to force herself. “Alright, good day,” she said curtly, and continued to walk down the main street. The man in the brown cloak stared at her for a moment, then resumed preaching about his church. Krause thought it was nonsense.</p>
            <p>She had spent the rest of the afternoon cooking. Around dusk, she noticed Henry outside of their cottage. He opened the door just as she was setting down the fresh cabbage stew. The first thing he did when he saw her was smile. “That smells amazing, Jules.” He moved towards her, kissing her softly on the top of her head.</p>
            <p>“I’m sure it tastes better than it smells, I’ve been working on this blasted cabbage stew for hours,” Krause smiled up at Henry. She glanced at Annemarie sleeping soundly in her crib under the window, framed beautifully by the setting sun. “How was your day? By the way, I saw Loretta today. Her and George say hi. Is it ok if we meet them for dinner on Sunday?”</p>
            <p>Henry sat down at the table, licking his lips as he looked at the stew. “Of course. We haven’t seen them in a while, it’ll be nice to catch up. And it was the same as normal, you know how it is. The harvest should be good this year. We might get enough to have some good pocket change, even more than I got today. Is that cabbage?”</p>
            <p>“Yes it’s cabbage, honey, I told you it’s cabbage stew. I’m sure you’ve heard the little devil begging for it recently.” Henry smiled first at Krause, then at the sleeping Annemarie. It took her a moment to process the last part of Henry’ sentence. Once she did, she exclaimed “That’s amazing, we could finally get you some new shoes!”</p>
            <p>Henry was hesitant for a moment. “I was thinking about something else.” She noticed as he smiled at his lap in the cute way he did when he was nervous. “Actually, I already got something.”</p>
            <p>Krause watched as he pulled a small silver necklace of a cross with a crimson ruby fixed to the center. “I know it’s out of nowhere, but I wanted to get you something that rivaled your beauty.”</p>
            <p>“I bet it took you all day to come up with that line,” Krause replied sarcastically, but she was smiling, failing to hold back tears of happiness. “How much was that, we couldn’t possibly keep it!”</p>
            <p>“Don’t worry, it’s not nearly as expensive as it looks. We should still have enough money to buy me a new pair of shoes.”</p>
            <p>Krause nodded, her tears now freely flowing down her cheeks. Henry grabbed her, bringing her close to him. “I love you.” They said at the same time.</p>
