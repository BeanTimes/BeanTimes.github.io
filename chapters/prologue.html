            <p>Bernadette Reneau was taking full advantage of the lovely day in Paris. She wore a light blue knitted jacket she had just finished making to protect her from the chill, excited at her chance to go to town. She had been working hard with her mother over the last couple of weeks, taking care of her younger siblings while her father worked. It was tiring, always having to take care of them, but her mother always said, “You’ll need these skills someday.” She wanted to argue, but what did she know?</p>
            <p>Bernadette walked down the street, her long, brown hair tossing in the breeze. As she headed towards the center of town, she came up to her favorite restaurant. There were a few people inside, sipping on drinks and eating the baked goods that were recently added to the menu. She pushed open the door, a small bell dinging as she entered. As she stepped in and began walking to the counter, the restaurant’s owner, Nicholas, greeted her.</p>
            <p>“Well, hello there Bernie! I had almost thought you’d died!”</p>
            <p>She grinned, stifling a laugh. “No, no, Nick. My mother was only working me to the bone at the house.”</p>
            <p>“Ah, is your father still working long hours?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, sadly, but he says that it will be worth it soon,” she replied, leaning on the counter.</p>
            <p>Nick opened his mouth to speak, but the sound of the bell cut him off.</p>
            <p>“Well, if it isn’t Bernadette! I was trying to get your attention for half a block back there, have you gone deaf?” Camille smiled as she entered the shop.</p>
            <p>“I have not, though it seems that voice of yours has gone dull in our time apart.”</p>
            <p>Camille gasped as though she had been hurt, clutching her chest and sighing dramatically. “You wound me, Bernadette.”</p>
            <p>Bernadette laughed, turning to order a drink from Nick as Camille ordered a croissant for herself. The two found a table and sat, talking as they waited for their food to be served.</p>
            <p>“So,” Camille said, looking at Bernadette, a serious look in her eyes, “Have you heard about this sickness that’s going around?”</p>
            <p>“I haven’t heard much. As you know, I’ve been stuck at home for a while now.”</p>
            <p>“Well, what I’ve heard is that a lot of people are suddenly feeling... off. Like overnight, they just…” she frowned, thinking hard, “stop being themselves. That’s just the beginning, though.”</p>
            <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“Well, my neighbor said her son caught it from the market. One day, he comes home all happy, and the next day, he’s hitting things off tables and just generally causing trouble. Then, a few days later, he has a bunch of growths on his arms and legs, like gangrene from the plague, though he doesn’t have any other plague symptoms. She says that the sickness is making him act up, and that it’ll go away soon, but I think there’s more to it...”</p>
            <p>Bernadette looked at Camille, noticing the anxiety in her friend’s eyes, wondering how she missed so much in only a couple weeks. As she looked at Camille’s face, Nick placed her drink in front of her. She took a sip and smiled; it was perfect, as always.</p>
            <p>Camille began again, “And that’s not even the weirdest part.”</p>
            <p>“It isn’t?”</p>
            <p>“Not at all. She said that her son claimed he felt something… moving... in his body.”</p>
            <p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
            <p>“He felt things inside him, and he kept claiming that they were making him misbehave.”</p>
            <p>“Honestly, that just sounds like a fever talking. I think this talk of sickness is just getting to people’s heads.”</p>
            <p>Camille took a bite of her croissant, ripping it off in one quick motion. She swallowed, then said, “No, I really think this is something more than that.”</p>
            <p>“Are you sure you haven’t caught it too? I mean, you sound crazy.”</p>
            <p>“Can you please take this seriously? I’m really stressed about this and you’re not helping.”</p>
            <p>“Sorry, it’s just that it sounds like some old ghost story or fairytale. I mean, something moving inside his body? That’s insane.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe you’re right... it’s nothing to worry about.” Camille stood, grabbing her now empty plate to return to Nick. “Well, I’m gonna go home, I didn’t sleep the best last night.”</p>
            <p>Her arm suddenly twitched, making her drop the plate which shattered on the floor. Everyone in the restaurant turned towards the noise. Nick grabbed a broom, walked over and began sweeping up the glass without looking at Camille. Bernadette stood, stepping around the shards to Camille, her friend’s face noticeably paler.</p>
            <p>“Are you alright?” Bernadette asked, looking at Camille in concern. Camille didn’t respond. Bernadette herded Camille to the exit of the shop, and said, “You must be really tired to be dropping plates like that. You look pale, are you feeling sick? Let’s get you home...”</p>
            <p>The mention of sickness pulled Camille out of her trance. She turned quickly to Bernadette, grasping her forearms tightly.</p>
            <p>“You don’t think I caught the sickness my neighbor had, right? Oh God, what if it’s... I think I feel it!” Camille said, her voice tense with fear.</p>
            <p>“No, no. I’m sure you’re just tired, I drop things all the time when I’m tired.”</p>
            <p>“M--- maybe you’re right. But I don’t twitch like... that... oh God.”</p>
            <p>“Hey, look at me. You’re okay. You’re probably just cold, here, take my jacket,” Bernadette said, sliding her jacket off and handing it to Camille. As she did that, she looked at her friend's arm and paused. Did something inside her just… move? She ignored it as she smiled at Camille and put the jacket over her shoulders.</p>
            <p>As Camille left, Bernadette walked over to Nick to help him finish cleaning the broken glass. After they were done, she took her cup off the table and brought it to the counter to be cleaned. Nick flashed her a thankful smile as Bernadette looked out of the window, noticing how low the sun was. She still had some shopping to do before she could get home to help with dinner.</p>
            <p>She was thanking Nick for the drink when, suddenly, screams erupted outside. Heads turned to the window as Bernadette ran to the shop front, throwing open the door and running out into the street, Nick close behind. They quickly ran towards the source of the screams.</p>
            <p>“What’s happening? It sounds like... they’re in pain,” Nick gasped.</p>
            <p>“I don’t know, I---” Bernadette cut herself off as she watched a woman dash out of a shop across the street, covered in blood. She made it to the middle of the road before her body tensed up, as if something was stopping her from moving. She fell to the floor, and Bernadette noticed something on her legs.</p>
            <p>Nick spoke as he bent down, getting a closer look at the woman. “What’s wrong with her legs? It looks like... they’re moving...” </p>
            <p>Bernadette stopped next to the woman and began to kneel down when a man ran out of the store, yelling, “Stop! Don’t touch her!”</p>
            <p>Bernadette stopped, confused.</p>
            <p>“Stay away from that woman if you want to live!” The man shouted again.</p>
            <p>Nick didn't move, instead turning the woman over. He looked at her face, frowning. Bernadette watched as he stood up, shaking something from his hand. He spoke, “She's dead, and she has... something on her.”</p>
            <p>“What is it?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know, but it’s moving.”</p>
            <p>“You need to leave,” the man shouted, “Something horrible is happening, and you don’t want to get hurt.”</p>
            <p>Before either of them could respond, more screams came from inside the shop. They turned and began walking towards it slowly. The man tried to stop them before giving up and running away himself. When they got to the front of the shop, Bernadette peered in through the window. </p>
            <p>She gagged.</p>
            <p>Bodies lay on the floor, covered in blood with small holes littering their skin. Some of them were still alive, panicking as they tried to comprehend what was happening. After taking a moment to steady herself, she looked inside again and noticed the same strange substance on all of the bodies.</p>
            <p>It was moving.</p>
            <p>A chill went down Bernadette's spine as she realized that Camille must have been right.</p>
            <p>“Nick, we need to go find Camille!”</p>
            <p>“But... all of these people...”</p>
            <p>“They’re dead! Look! We have to go!” Bernadette shouted.</p>
            <p>Nick looked at her then nodded. They ran towards Camille’s home, the rest of the city slowly falling into chaos around them. As they turned onto Camille’s street, a woman from another house ran out and grabbed Nick, begging him for help. Her limbs twitched awkwardly.</p>
            <p>Nick yelped as the woman’s hands closed on his arm. “Go get Camille!” He shouted.</p>
            <p>Bernadette ran, not looking back as she heard Nick fight the woman. She rounded the corner, noticing a woman lying in the road. Her messy hair stuck out from a knitted hat that had fallen off, the light blue jacket Bernadette had lent her stained red. </p>
            <p>“No!” Bernadette sprinted to the body, falling on her knees and grabbing the head of the person, turning her face up. “Cam--- Camille?” Bernadette whispered, staring at her dead friend’s face.</p>
            <p>“Camille, please... Please...”</p>
            <p>Camille’s lifeless eyes bored holes into Bernadette as tears began to fall down her face. Bernadette was so absorbed in looking over Camille’s lifeless body, she didn't notice something begin to climb up her legs.</p>
            <p>With shaking hands, Bernadette pulled back the jacket, taking in the sight of the holes littering Camille’s arms and collarbone. Camille’s skin had split open, and it only got worse further down her arm. She gasped, crying even harder now.</p>
            <p><i>She was right, there was something wrong with her...</i></p>
            <p>Bernadette was pulled from her thoughts as she felt something on her leg. She recognized the substance. It was the same that had been on the other bodies. She yelped and tried to brush it off, but it was replaced immediately. The substance moved further up her legs, stopping her attempts to stand. She began to panic, the substance moving steadily up her body, locking her in place. She screamed, trying to straighten her legs, trying to kick away the substance, to no avail. </p>
            <p>It was spreading too rapidly to fight.</p>
            <p>She glanced around and realized dully that Nick wasn’t there. She could no longer hear him fighting and tried once again to push the substance off of her legs, but there was too much now. Her tears stopped as a numbness began to set in.</p>
            <p>“I’m… dying…”</p>
            <p>This realization didn’t hit as hard as she thought it would. She crawled slowly towards Camille. At this moment, she thought of her family. Would they know what happened? Would her mom be angry that she wasn’t home on time? Would her father look for her? Would he get hurt, too? She wished she could see them again, to tell them she loved them.</p>
            <p>She felt the substance moving up to her stomach.</p>
            <p>Nick shouted in the distance. She turned her head to look at the direction it came from, but couldn’t see him. She didn’t know what happened, but the silence that followed the yelling said enough. She felt the substance reach her collarbone.</p>
            <p>Bernadette looked at Camille’s body. She looked so peaceful, staring up at the sky. She turned to look at the sky herself. The substance had reached her neck at this point, and was beginning to touch her face.</p>
            <p>She felt for Camille’s hand. When she finally found it, she held it. <i>Her body is still warm</i>, Bernadette realized as the substance covered her mouth, suffocating her.</p>
            <p>She continued to stare at the sky as the substance covered the rest of her face.</p>
            <p><i>It really had been a lovely day</i>, she thought.</p>
