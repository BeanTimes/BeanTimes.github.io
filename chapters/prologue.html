            <p>It was a lovely day in Paris, and Bernadette Reneau was taking full advantage of it. She wore a blue knitted jacket she had just finished making to protect her from the chill. She was excited to go to town, as she had been working hard with her mother over the last couple weeks taking care of her younger siblings while her father worked. It was tiring always having to take care of them, but her mother always said, “You’ll need the skills someday.” What did she know, though?</p>
            <p>Bernadette walked down the street, her long, brown hair tossed by the breeze. She was heading towards the center of town. As she did, she came up to a coffee shop she loved. There were a few people inside, sipping on drinks or the baked goods that were recently added to the menu. She pushed open the door, a small bell dinging as she did. She stepped in and began walking to the counter, the shop’s owner, Nicholas, noticed her approach.</p>
            <p>“Well, hello there Bernie! I almost thought you’d died!”</p>
            <p>She grinned, stifling a laugh at that. “No, no, Nick. My mother was working me to the bone at the house.”</p>
            <p>“Ah, is your father still working long hours?”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, he says that we will get a wonderful treat out of it though,” she said, leaning on the counter.</p>
            <p>As Nick opened his mouth to speak, the sound of the bell cut him off.</p>
            <p>“Well, if it isn’t Bernadette! I was trying to get your attention for half a block, have you gone deaf?”</p>
            <p>“I have not, though apparently that voice of yours has gone dull in our time apart.”</p>
            <p>Camille gasps as though she had been hurt, clutching her chest. “You wound me Bernadette.”</p>
            <p>Bernadette laughed, turning to order a coffee from Nick as Camille leaned around her to order a croissant for herself. The two walked over to a table and sat, waiting for their food to be served.</p>
            <p>“So,” Camille said, looking at Bernadette, a serious look in her eyes, “Have you heard about this sickness that’s going around?”</p>
            <p>“I haven’t heard much. As you know, I’ve been stuck at home for a while now.”</p>
            <p>“Well, what I’ve heard is that a lot of people are suddenly feeling... off. Like, overnight, they just…” she frowns, thinking hard, “stop being themselves.”</p>
            <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“Well, my neighbor said her kid caught it from the market. One day, he comes home all happy, and the next day he had a bunch of growths on his arms and legs, like gangrene from the plague. He doesn’t have any other plague symptoms, but he was acting strange, hitting stuff off counters, and just generally causing trouble. She says that the sickness is making him act up, but I think there’s more to it.”</p>
            <p>Bernadette looked at Camille, recognizing fear in her friend’s face, wondering how she missed so much in only a couple weeks. As she thinks, Nick places her coffee in front of her. She takes a sip and smiles, perfect as always.</p>
            <p>Camille began again. “She said her son kept claiming that he wasn’t doing it, and that his body was moving on it’s own, almost as if he was possessed. And that’s not even the weirdest part.”</p>
            <p>“It isn’t?”</p>
            <p>“Not at all. She said that her son claimed he felt something… moving. In his body.”</p>
            <p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
            <p>“He felt things inside him, and he kept claiming that they were controlling him.”</p>
            <p>“Honestly, that just sounds like the fever talking. I think this sickness is just getting to people’s heads.”</p>
            <p>Camille takes a large bite of her croissant, ripping a piece off in one quick, terse motion. She quickly swallows it then says, “No, I really think this is something more than that.”</p>
            <p>“Are you sure you haven’t caught it too? I mean, you sound crazy.”</p>
            <p>“Can you please take this seriously? I’m really stressed and you’re not helping.”</p>
            <p>“Sorry, it’s just that it sounds like something a kid would say. I mean, something moving inside his body? That’s insane.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe you’re right, it’s nothing to worry about, right?” Camille stood, grabbing her now-empty plate to return to Nick. “Well, I’m gonna go home, I’m really tired for some reason.”</p>
            <p>As she rose, her arm suddenly twitched, causing her to drop the plate, shattering it on the floor. Everyone in the coffee shop turned towards the noise. Nick grabs a broom, walking over to begin sweeping up the glass, quietly asking the small line of patrons to move over so he could reach all the shards. Bernadette stands, stepping around the shards to Camille, her friend’s face noticeably paler.</p>
            <p>“Are you alright?” Bernadette asks, looking at Camille in concern. Camille doesn’t respond, too lost in thought. Bernadette herded Camille to the exit of the shop, and said, “You must be tired to be dropping plates like that. Are you sure you’re not just tired? You look pale, are you feeling sick?”</p>
            <p>The mention of sickness seemingly pulls Camille out of her trance and she turns quickly to Bernadette, grasping her forearms with a tight grip.</p>
            <p>“You don’t think I caught the sickness my neighbor had, right? Oh god, what if it is bad... I think I feel it,” Camille says, her voice tense and laced with fear.</p>
            <p>As much as Bernadette would like to gloat that she was right, the way Camille was acting told her this wasn’t the time. Besides, she could always brag later.</p>
            <p>“No, no. I’m sure you’re just tired, I drop things all the time when I’m tired.”</p>
            <p>“M--- maybe you’re right. But I don’t twitch like that... oh god.”</p>
            <p>“Hey, look at me. You’re okay. You’re probably just cold, here, take my jacket,” Bernadette says, sliding the jacket off and handing it to Camille. As she does this, she looks at her friends arms and pauses. Did something inside her just… move? Bernadette decides to worry about that later, and fixes Camille with a smile as she puts on the jacket. They say their goodbyes and Camille turns and begins quickly walking home.</p>
            <p>Bernadette walked over to Nick to help him finish cleaning the glass. After it was all picked up, she took her coffee cup off the table and brought it to the counter to be cleaned. Nick flashes her a thankful smile as he tends to the other customers waiting for their food.</p>
            <p>Bernadette looked at the sun out of the window, now low in the sky, and realized that she spent more time than she wanted to at the shop. She had to go do some shopping so she could get home in time to help with dinner. She was thanking Nick for the coffee when, suddenly, screams erupted outside. Heads turned to the window and Bernadette ran to the shop front, throwing open the door and running out onto the street. Nick followed her, always ready to help. They quickly began running towards the center of town, where the screams were coming from.</p>
            <p>“What’s happening? It sounds like they’re in pain.” Nick heaved.</p>
            <p>“I don’t know, I---”</p>
            <p>Bernadette cut herself off as she watches a woman dash out of a shop across the street, covered in blood. She made it to the middle of the road before her body tensed up, as if something was stopping her from moving. She sunk to the floor, and Bernadette took notice of something on her legs.</p>
            <p>“What is on her legs? It’s like they’re moving.” She says, moving faster to catch up with Nick. He bent down, trying to get a closer look at the woman. Bernadette finally stopped next to the woman and was beginning to kneel down when a man ran out of the store, yelling.</p>
            <p>“Stop! Don’t touch that woman!”</p>
            <p>Bernadette straightened up, confused.</p>
            <p>“Stay away from her if you want to live!”</p>
            <p>Nick didn't move, instead turning the woman over to see her face. He looked into her eyes, frowning. Bernadette watched as he stood up, shaking something from his hand. Nick wipes his hand on his shirt saying, “She's dead, and she also has... something on her.”</p>
            <p>“What is it?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know, but it’s moving.”</p>
            <p>“You guys need to leave,” the man interjected, “Something horrible is happening, and you don’t want to get into trouble.”</p>
            <p>Before either of them could respond, more screams came from inside the shop. They turned and began walking towards it with trepidation. The man tried to stop them before giving up and rushing away himself. When they got to the front of the shop, Bernadette peered in through the window, gagging upon what she saw inside.</p>
            <p>Bodies littered the floor, covered in blood with small holes littering their skin. There were living people as well, panicking as they tried to comprehend what was happening. After taking a moment to steady herself with a shaky breath, she looked inside again and noticed the same substance on all of the bodies, and even on some of the still living people. Something wiggling, writhing on the bodies. A chill went down Bernadette's spine as she realized that Camille must have been right. <i>Wait, Camille! Is she okay?</i></p>
            <p>“Nick, we need to go find Camille.”</p>
            <p>“But... all of these people...”</p>
            <p>“They’re dead! Look! We have to go.” Bernadette snapped.</p>
            <p>Nick looked at her then nodded. They begin heading towards Camille’s home, and just as they are about to turn onto the street Camille lives on, they are stopped by a woman who rushes out of her home and grabs onto Nick, begging for help. She didn’t look right, her limbs twitching and lurching about. Nick yelped as her hands closed on his arm. Bernadette kept running, not looking back as she heard Nick fight off the woman. She rounded the corner, noticing a body lying in the road. The sight of messy blonde hair stuck out from a knitted hat that had fallen off and a blue jacket stained with red met her eyes.</p>
            <p><i>No.</i> Bernadette sprinted to the body, falling on her knees and grabbing the head of the person, turning the face up and--- <i>No, no, no!</i></p>
            <p>“Cam--- Camille?” Bernadette whispered, staring at her friend’s face.</p>
            <p>“Camille, please... Please be okay...”</p>
            <p>Camille’s lifeless eyes bored holes into Bernadette as tears began to fall down her face. Bernadette was so absorbed in looking over Camille’s lifeless body, she didn't notice something began to climb up her legs.</p>
            <p>With shaking hands, Bernadette pulled back the jacket, taking in the sight of the holes littering Camille’s arms and collarbone. Camille’s skin had split open, and it only got worse further down her arm. She gasped, crying even harder now. <i>She was right, there was something moving inside her. Something---</i> Bernadette was pulled from her thoughts as she felt something on her thigh. She recognizes the substance, the same that had been on the other bodies. She yelped and tried to brush it off, but it was replaced immediately, and the substance moved further up her legs. She attempted to stand, and realized that she could not. She pushed harder, but the substance on her legs prevented her from doing so. She screamed, sitting back, trying to straighten her legs, trying to kick away the substance to no avail. It was spreading too rapidly to fight.</p>
            <p>She glanced around and realized dully that Nick wasn’t there. She could no longer hear him fighting and tried once again to push the substance off of her legs, but there was too much of it. Her tears stopped as a numbness set in, her strength sapped from the running and fighting.</p>
            <p><i>I’m going to die.</i> This realization didn’t hit as hard as she thought it would. She used her arms and pulled herself so she was laying next to Camille. At this moment, she thought of her family. Would they know what happened? She knew her mom would be angry that she wasn’t home on time? When would that turn to concern? That hadn’t happened often before. Would her father look for her? Would he get sick? She wished she could see them again, and tell them she loved them. She felt the substance on her stomach, and heard Nick yell in the distance.</p>
            <p>She turned her head to look at the direction it came from, but couldn’t see him. She didn’t know what happened, but the silence that followed the yelling said enough. She felt the substance reach her collarbone.</p>
            <p>Bernadette looked at Camille’s body. She looked so peaceful, staring up at the sky. Bernadette also noticed that unlike herself, most of the substance was hidden under her friend’s clothes, and was suddenly very glad she gave Camille the jacket, though she was cold herself. The substance had reached her neck at this point, and was beginning to touch her face.</p>
            <p>She felt for Camille’s hand with her fingers, lacing them together when she did. <i>Her body is still warm,</i> Bernadette realized as the substance covered her mouth, preventing her from breathing. She stared at the sky, as the rest of the substance began blocking her nose. She couldn’t breathe anymore, and her eyes took in the sky in the last few seconds before her vision faded.</p>
            <p>It was a lovely day in Paris, and Bernadette could no longer enjoy it. Her body was no longer hers, and she was tired. Oh, so tired.</p>
