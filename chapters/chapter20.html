                November 30th, 1587 - West of Dijon, Kingdom of France

            <h3>
                There are currently three known species of drone Beans, those being: the dark red Beans with malleable shells that attacked Dijon, which we refer to as Crimson Beans; the white Beans with tough shells that appeared farther north, named Ashen Beans; and the weaker but faster green Beans from the south, named Verdant Beans.
            </h3>

            <p>Schmidt wasn’t used to riding a horse, especially over long distances. He was getting a rash from the constant rubbing of the saddle against his legs, and his muscles were sore from the effort of keeping himself constantly balanced.</p>
            <p>The scouting party had passed the ruins of Dijon on November 28th. They had decided to keep their distance from the city, though they could clearly see the destroyed sections of the wall where the abnormal crimson Bean had attacked. The ruins were completely devoid of life, both Bean and human. The faint smell of death hung in the air outside of Dijon, though he didn’t see any of the bodies that had been left outside the eastern gate. He had felt sick as they passed.</p>
            <p>That night, they had set up a simple camp near a small group of trees in the French countryside. They split into two watches; Schmidt and Greg would take first watch, while Rob and Marvin would take second. Schmidt’s watch was mostly silent, though he and Greg had eventually reopened their discussion about spirit and valor as the night dragged on. Schmidt also explained some of his theories about the Beans, and they had a conversation about what the Beans’ goals were. Neither of them were able to decide anything conclusive, however.</p>
            <p>The next morning, they continued to head west. As they rode, the hills became more frequent and the roads became less worn. Until Marvin pointed it out, Schmidt hadn’t realized how quiet it was. There were no birds singing, no squirrels chirping; nothing besides the soft breeze against the trees and the clopping of their horses' hooves.</p>
            <p>The part that gave Schmidt the most anxiety was how normal everything seemed. The ground wasn’t covered with Beans. The empty cities still stood. The wind still blew. The sun still rose and set. The lack of other humans and the eerie quiet was the only thing that separated Bean territory from the countryside outside of Rohrdorf.</p>
            <p>By the evening of the 29th, the scouting party was beginning to get comfortable heading west. Rob had acted comfortable with their trip from the beginning, though Schmidt could tell that he was just as anxious as himself. Marvin remained quiet through the majority of the trip, riding at the back of the group and keeping to himself. Greg stayed at the front of the group the whole time, rotating between discussing the philosophy of war with Rob, who seemed to be lost through the majority of their discussions, and theorizing about the Beans with Schmidt. Over dinner that night, they discussed their mission and decided to continue for one more day before returning to Besançon and giving their report to Kaplan. Schmidt had first watch with Marvin that night, who only spoke to wake Greg up and switch shifts.</p>
            <p>They had left their camp late on the morning of the 30th. After about an hour, a city came into view and they debated whether or not they should scout it. It was similar to Dijon; completely deserted of Beans, humans, and corpses, though this city’s walls remained intact besides the broken southern gate. They decided against scouting the city, and continued west.</p>
            <p>As the sun rose to its peak, Schmidt began to get irritated by his rash. They rode over the increasingly uneven roads, cresting small hills every few minutes, just to ride back down to the foot of another hill.</p>
            <p>“Not that I don’t agree with you, Mr. Gregory, but I do think that keeping the soldiers ignorant of the Beans was the only way to go about it,” Rob began. “You know that we can’t keep our mouths shut. If the higher ups had decided to tell every footsoldier about the Beans, there would be mass panic!”</p>
            <p>“Yes, Mr. Robert, I understand that portion of your argument, though I presume that informing the soldiers that there was a potential threat may have prevented many of the needless casualties suffered last month,” Greg replied.</p>
            <p>“It’s not like we were attacked by surprise. Captain Bösch had been informed of the Beans by General Krüger hours before they attacked Dijon. The captain had also said that he was not the only person preparing for an attack, meaning that a lot of commanding officers knew something was gonna happen. Telling the commanding officers while keeping the footsoldiers in the dark was the best strategy, I think. The only problem was that the Beans were much stronger than they had expected, and some fighting between the captain and the other soldiers caused a bunch of needless death in Dijon.”</p>
            <p>Marvin’s voice was barely loud enough for the others to hear. “Why even go into French territory, though? Why not secure our borders first, then prepare for an attack.”</p>
            <p>“Well, if the soldiers got overwhelmed, like we did, they could’ve just retreated back to the Empire’s borders and fortified there, like we did. We don’t lose any territory and less people die,” Rob replied. “They had everything planned from the start, all they did wrong was underestimate the Beans.”</p>
            <p>“If they had planned everything out, do you suppose this frantic search for information was also a part of their plan?” Greg asked. “We are sitting ducks in Besançon, all it takes is a single Bean attack and we all die needlessly. No one has so much as seen a Bean for a month, and they expect us to find a way to kill them? It is all so foolish.”</p>
            <p>“How else are we supposed to find out how to kill them, though?” Rob asked. After no one responded, he added “Barry, you’ve been awfully quiet. How do you feel about all this?”</p>
            <p>They had crested another hill, and began to ride down the other side as they continued west.</p>
            <p>“I feel like my legs are on fire,” Schmidt replied.</p>
            <p>“Gimme a serious answer, Barry.”</p>
            <p>“I agree with you. I think that the Empire handled everything as well as they could have. They didn’t cause a mass panic, they didn’t lose any territory. The only thing they lost was men.”</p>
            <p>“Thousands of men died, and you write it off as some kind of victory,” Greg said. “You only think of yourself. We should be advancing on Bean territory as an army, not sending ragtag scouting missions to die in the countryside.”</p>
            <p>“Wouldn’t sacrificing our soldiers just cause more needless death? You seem to be losing your spirit, Greg.”</p>
            <p>“I would gladly lead my fellow brothers in arms into battle with the Beans. There is nothing that exemplifies spirit more. And my name is Gregory, please refer to me properly.”</p>
            <p>“You’re missing my point, Gregory. Wouldn’t leading an assault on the Beans cause just as much needless death as letting them advance on us in Besançon?”</p>
            <p>“There is a difference between willingly volunteering to fight against a worthy threat and sitting and waiting for that same enemy to attack first, though you most likely would not understand. Sometimes sacrificing the willing few for the safety of the unwilling many is more noble than waiting to react to an attack we may not even survive.”</p>
            <p>“You wouldn’t be saying that if you saw what the Beans could do.” Schmidt’s voice was low. “Even if you caught them by surprise, you would be no match. There’s nothing we can do but wait until we find out how to kill them.”</p>
            <p>They began to climb another hill. Each step from Schmidt’s horse caused his rash to burn worse. There was an awkward silence before Rob spoke. “That’s enough of that, I think. Maybe those other scouting groups weren’t killed by the Beans, but killed each other before they got back.”</p>
            <p>There was silence besides a barely audible reply from Marvin that got lost in the wind.</p>
            <p>Rob started talking again. “It’s a really nice day, though, isn’t it? The sun is out, the sky is clear, the only thing is that it’s a little chilly… But, some people like that, you know? I’m just not one of them. Except, I don’t like it when it’s too hot, either, because then I start to get sweaty and…”</p>
            <p>There was silence as they crested a hill.</p>
            <p>“Do… do you guys see that?” Rob asked, pointing off the road to the north. “That… doesn’t look like a tree to me…”</p>
            <p>Schmidt turned towards where Rob was pointing. In the center of a field a few hundred meters away was a reddish brown object. It was the size and shape of a human, and was completely still.</p>
            <p>“Please tell me that’s not what I think it is…” Rob said.</p>
            <p>“I think it is...” Schmidt replied.</p>
            <p>“And what do you think it is, Mr. Robert?” Greg asked.</p>
            <p>“A Crimson Bean,” Rob said.</p>
            <p>“A Crimson Bean? That? Surely, you jest.”</p>
            <p>“No, he’s being serious,” Schmidt said. “We should be careful, we don’t know what it’s going to do.”</p>
            <p>“But, it is just... standing, there, in that field. It does not seem to have moved a single step. Those monsters can not even see, correct? Then there should be no way that it would be able to detect us from such a distance.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t underestimate them. I don’t want to die, at least not yet. If you want to put your life on the line, go ahead, but don’t drag mine in too. I like it too much to lose it in some godforsaken field in the middle of nowhere.”</p>
            <p>“Alright then. So, how shall we proceed?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. You’re the leader, Gregory.”</p>
            <p>Greg sighed, then took a deep breath and closed his eyes. After a moment, he opened them and turned to face the rest of the group. “First, we will stay here and wait. I want eyes in all directions, keeping watch for any movement. If we see anything, anything at all, we return to camp with the information we have and call it a day. If not… we will head toward the Bean and gather as much information as we can without harm befalling any of us. We retreat at the first sign of danger. Is that clear?”</p>
            <p>Schmidt and Rob nodded.</p>
            <p>Each man sat on their horses facing different directions. Schmidt was facing the direction of the Bean, which continued to do nothing in the center of the field. It was far enough away that he couldn’t make out any defining features, but it looked the same as the other crimson Beans that had attacked Dijon the month before. A featureless face and similar proportions to a human, though this one was completely motionless.</p>
            <p>They stood in complete silence, the only sound being that of the breeze over the dying grass.</p>
            <p>Schmidt shivered, wrapping his cloak tighter around himself.</p>
            <p>Without the normal sounds of nature around him, it felt as though he were no longer on Earth. There were so many sounds he had never thought about. Here he stood, in the middle of the countryside.</p>
            <p>It was quiet.</p>
            <p>It was empty.</p>
            <p>They were alone.</p>
            <p>Schmidt shivered again. He began rubbing his arms to try and warm himself up, even though it really wasn’t that cold. It was probably around ten degrees, only slightly uncomfortable for him normally, but the air felt like it was piercing his skin, freezing him right to the bone.</p>
            <p>He hadn’t thought of it much, but if he had to guess, this was what Hell would be like. Desolate, still, and cold.</p>
            <p>“Has it been long enough, Mr. Gregory?” Rob asked.</p>
            <p>“A few more minutes,” Greg replied simply.</p>
            <p>And so they waited.</p>
            <p>Nothing moved.</p>
            <p>The Bean stood motionless in the middle of the field.</p>
            <p>Their horses stood silently. For a moment, Schmidt was able to forget about his rash.</p>
            <p>He thought he noticed something move far in the distance, though it was just his imagination.</p>
            <p>Silence.</p>
            <p>Piercing silence.</p>
            <p>He tried to steady his breathing, but he couldn’t stop his heart from racing in his chest. What if this was a trap? The Beans weren’t stupid. They could have planned this. Maybe this was how they were able to kill those other scouting groups. Maybe the other groups just weren’t careful enough. Maybe it didn’t matter, and they were dead the moment Rob pointed the Bean out. Maybe they were dead the moment they left Besançon.</p>
            <p>Maybe they were dead the moment they saw the first Bean outside of Dijon.</p>
            <p>“No one saw anything?” Greg asked.</p>
            <p>The others remained silent.</p>
            <p>“Good. We head towards the Bean, then.” Greg began to guide his horse in the direction of the Bean. “Remember, at the first sign of danger, we retreat. If we get separated, we can regroup outside of that city we passed a few hours earlier. I hope to God that it does not come to that, however.”</p>
            <p>The others followed in silence.</p>
            <p>Nothing moved as they approached the Bean.</p>
            <p>They slowed down once they got within ten meters of the Bean. It continued to stand motionless in the field.</p>
            <p>They stood and watched, waiting for something to happen. Anything.</p>
            <p>The Bean was facing to their right, the side of its body prone. It stood with its arms at its side, its legs together. Despite the distance, Schmidt could smell the sickly sweet scent of rotting fruit.</p>
            <p>“Hey, Barry... can you give me your helmet?” Rob asked.</p>
            <p>“Why do you need it?”</p>
            <p>“Just give it to me.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt complied. Rob inspected Schmidt’s helmet for a few moments before finally grabbing it by the back in his right hand. He threw it at the Bean.</p>
            <p>Schmidt watched as the helmet sailed through the air, seemingly slower than it should have. He held his breaths as it hit the Bean in the side of the arm. He watched as the helmet fell onto the ground, clattering as small clumps of beans fell onto it.</p>
            <p>The Bean didn’t move.</p>
            <p>“Mr. Robert, you could have killed us all with that stunt!” Greg shouted.</p>
            <p>Rob slid off his horse and began to walk cautiously towards the immobile Bean. “But I didn’t, and that’s all that matters, isn’t it?”</p>
            <p>Schmidt dismounted his horse and followed Rob. “You should’ve at least warned us before you did it though.”</p>
            <p>“That’s true, but I thought it would’ve taken off a bit of the edge. Guess it didn’t.”</p>
            <p>Greg followed. “Just, warn us next time, please.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt, Rob, and Greg gathered around the Bean. Some smaller beans had fallen on top of Schmidt’s helmet. Slowly, he picked it up and brushed the beans off.</p>
            <p>They stared silently at the Bean.</p>
            <p>“Why is it---” Marvin began.</p>
            <p>“WHAT THE HELL!” Rob screamed, stumbling backwards, barely missing the Bean. “Oh my <i>God</i>, I forgot you were here, Marvin… You can’t just sneak up on people like that!”</p>
            <p>“Sorry,” Marvin said.</p>
            <p>“No, it’s not your fault… You’re just so quiet. Maybe we should put a bell on you or something.”</p>
            <p>“No, thanks.”</p>
            <p>“Anyways, what were you saying?” Rob took a deep breath and sat down in the grass in front of the Bean, which was still motionless.</p>
            <p>“Why is it paralyzed, do you think?” Marvin asked.</p>
            <p>“You’re asking the wrong people,” Rob replied.</p>
            <p>“What should we do about it, though?” Greg asked. “This is vital information, we can not just leave it standing here in this field.”</p>
            <p>“If you want to put it on your horse, go ahead, but I’m not riding with that thing,” Schmidt said, walking around the Bean, inspecting it up close. The helmet felt heavy in his hands.</p>
            <p>He hadn’t got a good look at the Beans in Dijon. When they were first attacked, it was too dark to make out many of the features, and when they escaped he was too busy fighting to inspect the Beans. Now, without any visible threat, he wanted to take his time and analyze this Bean. Who knew if anyone would get a chance like this again?</p>
            <p>The crimson Bean was made up of a large amount of small reddish brown ovals, which Schmidt assumed were the beans that they were named after, separated by a very thin layer of thick white liquid that reminded Schmidt of puss. The monster smelled horrible from far away, so Schmidt had to hold his breath to prevent himself from gagging up close. The surface of the Bean’s shell wasn’t smooth despite how it looked from far away, the beans jutting out at different heights all over the Bean’s body. It’s proportions were slightly different from a normal human, though Schmidt couldn’t put his finger on exactly what. It would not have been obvious from a distance that the proportions were different, either. Its head was featureless, its fingers were long, and its feet were long and without toes. The Bean had no genitalia, hair, or nails.</p>
            <p>Schmidt lifted his helmet and slowly began to move it towards the Bean.</p>
            <p>“Woah, Barry, I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Rob said, standing up from his position in the grass.</p>
            <p>“Well, you threw it at the Bean earlier and nothing happened.”</p>
            <p>“This is not the same, Mr. Schmidt,” Greg said, walking towards Schmidt. “It could easily grab you at that distance, which can potentially lead to your demise.”</p>
            <p>“If it grabs me, you guys can retreat without me. I want to know something first,” Schmidt replied.</p>
            <p>“Wait,” Marvin said, walking over to his horse. “Before you do that, we should get a sample.”</p>
            <p>“A sample? Of what?” Schmidt asked.</p>
            <p>“Of the beans.” He pulled a glass jar out of his horse’s pack and handed it to Schmidt. “Take some of the smaller beans and put them in this. We can seal it, and bring it back to Stuttgart. The doctors could use something like this.”</p>
            <p>“That is... an excellent idea, Marvin,” Greg said, a smile beginning to form on his face. “I’m glad you are here, soldier. That’s the best idea any of us have had all day.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt took the jar from Marvin and grabbed a few of the fallen beans from the ground. They were like ice; cold enough that he had to warm his fingers before grabbing more from the ground. Eventually he gave up picking the beans from the ground individually and slowly grabbed a handful from the Bean itself, though he quickly regretted it. The sensation reminded him of shoving his hand into thick, freezing mud. Once the jar was full, he returned it to Marvin who sealed it tight, then wrapped it in parchment.</p>
            <p>“If that’s everything…” Schmidt said as he glanced at the other soldiers. None of them said anything. Rob nodded slightly. Schmidt grabbed his helmet from the ground.</p>
            <p>He drove the top of the helmet into the Bean’s head. It slid in for a few centimeters before stopping. The beans were pushed to the side, warping the Bean’s head and dropping beans to the ground.</p>
            <p>Nothing happened.</p>
            <p>He held the helmet in the Bean’s head for a moment, waiting for something to happen. After a moment, he began to pull it out. Small clumps of beans fell to the ground as the helmet slid further out of the Bean. Finally, it came out with a wet sucking sound. Schmidt looked into the cavity that his helmet had left.</p>
            <p>He froze. </p>
            <p>His eyes went wide as he stared at what was inside the Bean’s head.</p>
            <p>“What’s wrong?” Rob asked anxiously as he began to approach Schmidt.</p>
            <p>Greg took a step towards Schmidt, Marvin followed.</p>
            <p>Schmidt didn’t move as the other three soldiers surrounded him, looking into the cavity on the Bean’s head.</p>
            <p>It was a woman. She was dead, her corpse covered with beans.</p>
            <p>She had begun to decompose inside of the Bean, her decaying skin smeared red and white, her eye sockets were empty, strands of matted brown hair streaking down her face, but it was unmistakable.</p>
            <p>Inside the Bean was the rotting corpse of a human woman.</p>
            <p>Marvin made a small whimpering sound and fell backwards.</p>
            <p>Rob gasped softly, averting his eyes and whispering something under his breath.</p>
            <p>Greg turned and doubled over, retching.</p>
            <p>Schmidt couldn’t look away.</p>
