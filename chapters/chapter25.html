            <h3>
                Our understanding of drone Bean physiology presents important questions regarding the physiology of abnormal Beans. Their increased size would suggest that there is more than one human corpse inside of them, though that would mean a single abnormal Crimson Bean would require dozens, maybe even hundreds of corpses. That only works under the assumption that the Beans need human bodies to function, however. Perhaps the abnormal Beans are able to survive without a human host, and the drone Beans are weaker due to their dependence on human corpses. I do not know; maybe no one will ever know. Perhaps there are many more forms of abnormal Beans that we have not determined yet… There have been no reports of an abnormal Ashen Bean. For now, we can only speculate.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Krause clutched Annemarie to her chest as she walked through Stuttgart’s market on her way to church. The harsh wind flew through the cramped alleys of the city, painfully beating against her.</p>
            <p>At first, she had been uncomfortable navigating through the large crowds, but she had been in Stuttgart long enough to not be shocked by the busy streets as much. Despite her decreased anxiety, she still moved carefully, sticking to the edge of the streets to avoid getting elbowed or bumped into.</p>
            <p>As she walked down the street, she passed people arguing with vendors over prices, which had gone up recently due to a shortage in supplies due to the Beans and the harsh winter. The snow had been heavy that year and their access to arable land had decreased significantly, causing food to become increasingly scarce as the winter went on.</p>
            <p>Captain Bösch, a high ranking member of the military, was in charge of managing the resources of Stuttgart and the surrounding regions. He had been open about the management of supplies, and how the Empire had deemed the soldiers on the western front to be the Empire’s first priority. Unfortunately, that left little for the citizens of Stuttgart, which was already overcrowded and undersupplied due to the influx of refugees.</p>
            <p>Tensions in the market were high. Many vendors had been forced to shut down due to the lack of goods available to sell, while the remaining vendors increased their prices, hoping to make enough of a profit so their families could survive the winter. Shoppers rushed around the market, trying to negotiate for lower prices before the items were sold out from under them. There had been enough fights between hagglers and vendors that soldiers had been stationed around the market to prevent any violence.</p>
            <p>Everyone was cold, hungry, and miserable.</p>
            <p>Krause shivered. Annemarie was heavy in her arms. The market was especially crowded today, and she wasn’t comfortable continuing through the dense crowd with Annemarie in her tired arms. She had left her home early, so she had more than enough time to take a break and wait for the market to clear up slightly before continuing to the Church meeting. She weaved through the crowd, still inexperienced with the large number of people constantly moving by. She narrowly avoided stray elbows, twisting her body to keep Annemarie out of harm’s way.</p>
            <p>Eventually, Krause managed to duck into a small alley behind a vendor selling clothes for double the price. She turned her attention to Annemarie, who slept peacefully in her arms, Krause’s necklace grasped loosely in her hand. There was a soft smile on her sleeping face that caused Krause to smile herself as she gently moved her hair frome Annemarie’s face.</p>
            <p>“Oh,” a woman beside Krause said. “I wasn’t expecting to see you here, Jules.”</p>
            <p>Krause looked up and saw Loretta Gartner standing next to her. Annemarie’s eyes opened, and she looked sleepily towards Loretta. “Cabbage?” she asked.</p>
            <p>Loretta smiled. “Sorry, Annemarie, but I don’t have any cabbage right now. Maybe another time.”</p>
            <p>Krause was silent, her eyes on Annemarie.</p>
            <p>Loretta sighed. “Look… I know we didn’t leave on the best note, but…”</p>
            <p>Annemarie grabbed the necklace tighter as she rested her head on Krause’s shoulder, closing her eyes again. Krause turned to face Loretta, trying to hold back her tears. She didn’t know why, but her emotions began to overwhelm her. “I’m... sorry, Loretta. You were right, I was a fool. I shouldn’t have let the stupid Church get in the way of my friends, my family.”</p>
            <p>Loretta carefully placed her arms around Krause as her sobs became harsher. “It’s alright. I forgive you, Julia. It was my fault you got involved in the Church in the first place.”</p>
            <p>Krause began to hyperventilate, feeling an immense sense of panic, tears beginning to roll down her cheeks. Loretta’s eyes went wide as she helped Krause sit down against the wall of the alley, placing Annemarie on the ground next to her. She had let go of the necklace, looking up at her mother, confused.</p>
            <p>“What’s wrong, Jules?” Loretta asked, who was now panicking herself. “It’s ok, you’re ok… Take deep breaths, you’re going to be fine…”</p>
            <p>Krause’s voice was hoarse. “I… can’t…"</p>
            <p>“You can’t what?”</p>
            <p> “This isn’t right… none of this is right… Loretta, help me. Please… help me…”</p>
            <p>Loretta stood above Krause, her face slowly filling with recognition. “You’re not… You’re not still involved in the Church, are you?”</p>
            <p>Krause was silent besides her shallow, quick gasps, punctuated with sharp sobs.</p>
            <p>“Jules, you need to get out of there. I don’t care what they say, I don’t care what you say. You can call yourself a fool, you can come crying to me all you want, but as long as you’re in the Church, you and your family are in danger. You <i>have</i> to get out of there!”</p>
            <p>Krause closed her eyes tight, tears flowing freely down her face. “I know… I know… I know…” She struggled to say that much. There was so much she had to say, so much she wanted to tell Loretta. But she couldn’t get herself to speak. The words formed a lump in her throat, she felt as though she was suffocating between the gasping and the tears and the sobs, her hands clenched into fists on the ground, filling with cold stones and dust. “Help… me…”</p>
            <p>Loretta looked between Krause and Annemarie. “I… What’s wrong? How can I help you? Tell me what---”</p>
            <p>“None of this is right!” Annemarie’s eyes were wide with fear as she watched her mother scream, writhing on the ground of a small alley. “What’s happening to me? This is your fault! You did this to me! You have to help me!”</p>
            <p>“Jules, what’s wrong with you? Hold on, I’m going to find a doctor.” Loretta picked up Annemarie as she walked towards the marketplace. Some people had stopped to watch. “I’m taking Annemarie, I don’t want her to get hurt.”</p>
            <p>Annemarie began to sob as Loretta rushed to find help.</p>
            <p>Krause got to her feet. As she rose, she realized that her mind had been fuzzy, though it was clear now. Clearer than it had ever been before, as though this was the first time she had truly opened her eyes. Her voice was low and calm, her face still wet with tears. “Let go of my daughter.”</p>
            <p>Loretta turned to face Krause, Annemarie crying loudly in her arms. “What’s going on with you?”</p>
            <p>“Give me back my daughter.”</p>
            <p>“Jules, I---”</p>
            <p>“Give my daughter back.”</p>
            <p>Krause took a step towards Loretta, who stumbled backwards in response. “What’s going on? What’s wrong with you?” Loretta looked the same way she did on the morning of October 5th, the day Krause had beaten her in a cabbage patch outside her home. “You can’t keep doing this!”</p>
            <p>She did not know why she remembered the date, or why thinking back on it made her grin. The simultaneous clarity and obscurity was confusing. Deep in the back of her mind she knew something was wrong, that she wasn’t acting how she should be. But she couldn’t stop herself. She wouldn’t. “Annemarie. Now.”</p>
            <p>Loretta held the screaming Annemarie out at arms length. Krause grabbed her, cradling her softly against her chest. Annemarie, still crying, grabbed at the necklace. Loretta said “You’re crazy, Jules… You’re insane…”</p>
            <p>Krause turned with Annemarie, heading deeper down the alley. In the back of her mind, she could still hear Loretta screaming at her on the morning of October 5th. “You’re a fool, Julia Krause! You’re not the Julia I used to know! The Jules I knew wouldn’t be acting like this! The Jules I knew would be thinking about Henry, about Annemarie! If you keep doing this, you’re going to get them killed! Your daughter, your husband, they’ll die! And you’re going to be the one that killed them!” That voice, too, was pushed to the back of her mind.</p>
            <p>She wasn’t going to get her family killed.</p>
            <p>She was going to save them.</p>
            <p>Krause felt as though she was floating outside of her body as she made her way to St. Nicholas’ Church. Krause’s mind was foggy as she listened to the meeting start and finish as usual, the regular congregation in attendance. Schulz explained their plans for the future of the Church, and the congregation was told what they would have to do to achieve that future.</p>
            <p>Finally, the congregation rose to leave. Among them was Leon, who immediately made his way to Krause, Sam following close behind. Krause felt a vague annoyance as he approached.</p>
            <p>“Alright, before you say you won’t tell me anything, just hear me out,” Leon began. “I’ve been to a few meetings, and I haven’t told anyone about the Church. That should be enough for at least some information from you! Please?”</p>
            <p>Krause replied, her mouth moving on its own. “You should know enough about our beliefs to decide if you’re comfortable practicing them. This is the last time we are going to have this conversation, Leon.”</p>
            <p>“No need to be so final about it! The thing is, though… I’m still not really sure what this religion practices? I know all the stuff about the Beanmeister being God, and how the Bean attacks are related to His expansion of power, and that He is the bringer of the rapture, but that’s kind of it… I still don’t actually <i>know</i> anything about what you believe. What’s considered right and wrong? Are there practices or rituals I should be aware of? These services haven’t been very informative. Most of the time it’s just Pastor Schulz praising the Beanmeister. I know the Church is based on Christian beliefs, so should I just assume you guys use the same Christian values?”</p>
            <p>Krause shook her head slowly, which made her feel light headed. “I thought you wanted information about the Beans.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, I do. I just thought you’d be more open to telling me about the Beans if you thought I was interested in the intricacies of the religion. And don’t get me wrong, I do want to know the intricacies of the religion, but I also really want to know about the Beans!”</p>
            <p>Sam finally spoke. “Come on, Julia, I think we can trust him. Like he said, he hasn’t told anyone about the Church, he follows our practices, and he’s come to a lot of services. He’s really a good guy, if you take the time to get to know him.”</p>
            <p>“Thanks, Sam!”</p>
            <p>Gloria watched the conversation from the pew, next to Pastor Schulz, who was discussing a passage of the Bible with her and how it related to the Beanmeister. When Krause noticed she was watching the conversation, Gloria returned her attention to Schulz.</p>
            <p>Krause spoke again, though her voice felt distant from her own ears. “You should know what we are trying to do by now. If you don’t, then you should stop coming to these services before something bad happens.”</p>
            <p>“Was that a threat?” Schubert asked, smirking.</p>
            <p>Krause narrowed her eyes. Leon narrowed his in return, holding his smirk.</p>
            <p>Sam put his hands between Leon and Krause. “Hey guys, don’t do anything---”</p>
            <p>Leon cut him off. “You should be careful when threatening people. You never know, you could threaten a useful member out of your church. But I’m not going to interpret that as a threat, I’m going to interpret it as a friendly warning from a high ranking member of the clergy. Thank you for the warning Julia. I will heed it… <i>faithfully</i>.”</p>
            <p>Krause continued to glare at Leon. “Was that all you came up here for?”</p>
            <p>“Hey, these are legitimate questions! I’m still trying to decide whether I should dedicate myself to the Beanmeister! And from what I’ve seen, you guys haven’t been able to do much besides spread a bad name for yourselves. That’s probably why you haven’t gotten any new members in weeks!”</p>
            <p>“If you don’t like the way we worship God then you don’t have to worship here.”</p>
            <p>Leon was beginning to raise his voice. “You’re not giving me a chance to understand <i>how</i> you worship God! These meetings are so weird and vague! Nothing happens, just Schulz saying ‘Oh, the Beanmeister is great and everything! Thessalonians! Worship the Beanmeister and don’t go to Hell!’ How am I supposed to worship the Beanmeister if I don’t know <i>how</i>!”</p>
            <p>Sam put his hands on Leon’s shoulders. “Hey, you should calm down, Leon. We’re in a church, after all. Maybe we should go. We can talk about this outside, I can explain what I think---”</p>
            <p>Leon pointed at Krause. “I don’t want you to explain it, I want <i>her</i> to explain it!”</p>
            <p>Krause’s voice was calm. “Listen to Sam and leave.”</p>
            <p>“No, I don’t think I will until I get the answers I want.”</p>
            <p>“Does this usually work for you? Screaming like a child, crying until you get what you want. You say you don’t know what these meetings are for, you say you don’t understand our religion, but that’s only because you don’t listen. Your ears are covered, your eyes are closed, you refuse to see the truth that is laid plainly before you. Uncover your ears, Leon. Open your eyes. We have done much more than simply spread a bad name for ourselves. You’ll see it soon. <i>Everyone</i> will see it soon. And if you haven’t been able to see what we have done, you’re a bigger fool than I thought you were. This is your final warning. Get out of this church.”</p>
            <p>Leon was still smirking. “There’s really no need to threaten me, Julia. You just need to tell me what I want to know. It’s that simple.”</p>
            <p>A strong hand fell onto Krause’s shoulder. With it came the voice of Pastor Schulz. He spoke slowly, almost lazily, as he glanced between Krause and Leon. “What’s going on here... Is everything alright?”</p>
            <p>“Has Leon been bothering you again, Krause?” Gloria asked.</p>
            <p>“Ah, you must be Leon Schubert. I’ve heard a lot about you. Unfortunately, not all of it has been positive,” Schulz said. “I want to hear the story from you. What’s going on here?”</p>
            <p>Leon’s smile faltered for the first time. “I just want to know some things about the Beans, and Julia has been withholding that information from me.”</p>
            <p>“Julia is under no obligation to explain anything to you, and it seems like you have been putting undue stress on her. Do you think that’s fair? Harassing a young woman for information?”</p>
            <p>“No, but I---”</p>
            <p>“He knows too much about us, pastor,” Gloria said. “He’s much too large of a liability to let live.”</p>
            <p>“Wait, let live?” Sam asked. “You’re not going to kill him, are you?”</p>
            <p>Schulz looked Leon in the eyes. “How many meetings have you attended?”</p>
            <p>Leon smiled half heartedly. “Nine, but I don’t see how---”</p>
            <p>Schulz shook his head sadly. “Now, here’s the thing, Leon… Nine meetings is a lot. You know our names, our faces, our religion. I’m not going to kill you, though… not yet, anyways. I’m just going to keep you here for a while. I’ll leave your fate up to Aaron, but just know that if we let you live, it would be in your best interest to keep all of this to yourself...” Schulz took a step towards Leon.</p>
            <p>Sam tried to put himself between Schulz and Leon, shouting for them to calm down and talk about it, but Gloria pulled him back. Krause watched in a daze as Schulz readied his fists. Leon looked around frantically, his eyes wide with fear, his mouth open, his hands held out in front of him defensively.</p>
            <p>Schulz took another step towards him.</p>
            <p>“Wait, wait, wait!” Leon shouted. “You can’t do this to me!”</p>
            <p>“And why is that?” Schulz asked. Sam shouted as Gloria held him back.</p>
            <p>“I was waiting for a good time to tell you! I was hoping I’d be higher up in the Church! If you kill me, you’ll lose out on the information I have in the government! That’s why I want to learn how much you know about the Beans, so I can know you’re part of the actual Church of the Beanmeister!”</p>
            <p>Schulz narrowed his eyes. “The government? What do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“I’m an important researcher for the Beans! I can help you!”</p>
