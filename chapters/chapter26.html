            <h3>
                We have only found three consistent ways to kill the Beans (assuming that Crimson Beans behave the same as Ashen and Emerald Beans); heat, crushing, and cleaving. The heat from a simple candle is enough to kill a bean placed within a few centimeters of the flame, while crushing and cleaving kills the bean if a large enough area is crushed or cut off. We have yet to develop weapons which take advantage of these weaknesses, however, besides primitive swords and heated weapons.

            <p>Dear Sofia,</p>
            <p>I’m writing to apologize, and to admit that I have been a fool.</p>
            <p>I got all of the letters you sent me, by the way. I got the last one in November. I should have responded then. I should have met you in Stuttgart, and I should have apologized to Captain Bösch instead of making everything worse. I’m sure he told you about what happened on the night of the party. If I could go back, I would never have signed up to patrol Dijon. Hell, I should have never joined the military in the first place.</p>
            <p>Look, what I’m trying to say is that I’ve made a lot of mistakes, maybe more than I can make up for, but I see that now, and I want to change.</p>
            <p>Seeing the Beans made me realize something. It’s taken me this long to come to terms with it myself, which is one of the reasons why I have been such a fool. I have realized that I do not want to die. I had lived for so long hoping to die brave and young in a blaze of glory on the battlefield that I never once considered a future where I would not, and you have suffered because of it.</p>
            <p>I am not writing this letter as an admission of defeat; I have not fallen into despair after finally beginning to understand myself. Instead, I have accepted that I do not want to die, which means that I have accepted my role in this fight. I’m not immortal, I’m not going to turn the tides of a battle to help win the day. I’m just a regular person that wants to protect other regular people.</p>
            <p>I’m going to do everything I can to help defeat the Beans. For you, for Uncle Humbert, for Rob, and for all the new friends I have made since the Beans first attacked. It’s only a matter of time until we’re able to defeat them. I’m sure you’ve heard by now that the Empire was able to get ahold of a Bean sample to study. Well, not to brag or anything, but I was part of the group that found and delivered the sample to Stuttgart. (That’s why I was in the city, by the way. I’m sure you already figured all this out, though. I’d be more surprised if you didn’t figure that out, but that’s not the point I’m trying to make.)</p>
            <p>I have full confidence that the people studying those beans will be able to find a weakness for us to take advantage of. And it will be my job to exploit that weakness to defeat the Beans, once and for all. I won’t let anyone I love get hurt. I swear.</p>
            <p>Again, I’m sorry. For everything.</p>
            <p>With love,</p>
            <p>Barry.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Schmidt and Rob made their way through the empty streets of Besançon to the church in the northwestern section of the city, where Lieutenant Kaplan was holding a meeting to decide who would go on that week's scouting mission. It was the same church where they originally met Kaplan after escaping Dijon, where two soldiers were currently watching for any Bean activity to the west.</p>
            <p>Kaplan’s platoon had taken refuge inside of the abandoned buildings instead of setting up a camp outside the safety of Besançon’s walls. Most of the areas of their improvised camp were near the eastern gate, since the soldiers were scared of the Beans attacking by surprise. Despite this, many of the platoon’s weapons and supplies were kept in the church.</p>
            <p>A light snow had fallen over the town the night before. Besides the soft crunching of Schmidt and Rob’s footsteps, the town was silent. The church came into view, Kaplan standing on top of the front steps waiting for everyone to gather.</p>
            <p>His confidence had been improving slowly since they returned from Stuttgart, and it had become increasingly obvious with each passing week. His head was held high, his posture straight as his eyes moved around the crowd, making eye contact with each individual soldier gathered in front of him. Kaplan stared at Schmidt and Rob as they approached. Rob waved in response.</p>
            <p>They stood in silence as the rest of the soldiers gathered. Greg and Marvin joined them after a few minutes. Kaplan’s stare pierced each of the soldiers.</p>
            <p>“Now,” Kaplan began, projecting his voice much more than necessary. “You all know the drill. Four volunteers. Last week’s group is exempt from this week’s scouting mission. Make it quick, please. We all have important jobs to do. We should not waste any more time here than we have to.”</p>
            <p>The usual silence followed. Although the knowledge of the Beans becoming immobile in the cold was commonplace, most of the soldiers in Kaplan’s platoon were still hesitant to volunteer to scout. After Schmidt’s group encountered a Bean, the reality set in farther for the soldiers. There was a very real chance that they would encounter a Bean on their mission. And, despite Kaplan’s posturing, he was still hesitant to scold his soldiers for disobedience.</p>
            <p>“I am not going to repeat myself. Four volunteers. Now.”</p>
            <p>To Schmidt’s left, a group of soldiers whispered and laughed with each other. Their laughter was especially loud, the snow dampening any other noises that would otherwise drown it out. Finally, one of the soldiers, Rolf Bergmann, spoke up. “What’re you going to do if no one volunteers, eh, Raphael?” The soldiers around him laughed.</p>
            <p>“I am going to choose four men myself,” Kaplan replied. “It’s as simple as that. Volunteer, or I will volunteer you myself.”</p>
            <p>Rolf laughed again. “You know, I’ve been wondering something. How did a man like yourself become a lieutenant in the Holy Roman Army? You’ve been my commanding officer for, what, four, five months now? I’ve seen you talk a big game, throw out threats, all the easy stuff, but I’ve never seen you get your hands dirty, Raphael. You seem like a much better fit for the French Royal Army. Even your name is French, you know?”</p>
            <p>Rob shook his head. “God, is he ever gonna stop talking? He’s just wasting everyone’s time.”</p>
            <p>Greg muttered “Why does he have to do this every week? It is bad enough that we have to deal with him during the rest of the week…”</p>
            <p>Rolf continued, waiting for his friends’ laughter to die down. “Raphael Kaplan. Why don’t you go join your fellow Frenchmen, eh? Go on the mission yourself, and while you’re there, maybe you could bring back a Bean. It’d be good for research or whatever, and it’d be more qualified to lead us than you, too. Maybe with a Bean in charge, we could do some actually important work here.”</p>
            <p>“Do you know why we are here, Rolf?” Kaplan asked, taking a step toward the crowd. “Do you know why we have been stationed in this town for months? Why we have been sending scouting missions west every single week? I am here, you are here, we are <i>all</i> here...” Kaplan glanced around the crowd, making eye contact with random soldiers in the group. Few of them returned it. “Because we have a job to do. We are here to protect the people that are unable to protect themselves. You can hide behind your tough guy persona all you want. You can insult me, you can insult your fellow soldiers. For all I care, you can insult Captain Bösch, or General Krüger, or General Ziegler, or even the Holy Roman Emperor himself. But it will not change the fact that, at the first sign of danger, you are going to run.”</p>
            <p>Kaplan glanced over the crowd again. “Do you think I want to be here? Do you think I want to spend my time taking care of you, a group of soldiers that are barely competent enough to clean a musket? I would much rather be doing the <i>important</i> work in Stuttgart, or Nuremberg, or Frankfurt, but I am stuck here, dealing with you. None of that changes the fact that we have a job to do. And no matter how unimportant you think this job is, someone needs to do it. We need information if we want to win against the Beans, and the only way we are going to get that information is if we send men to collect it. We still need four scouts. Are you going to volunteer, Bergmann, or are you going to run?”</p>
            <p>Rolf’s smirk wavered.</p>
            <p>Rob narrowed his eyes. “What the hell has been up with Kaplan recently?”</p>
            <p>Greg replied. “I do not know. He has changed considerably in the past few weeks.”</p>
            <p>Marvin said “Maybe he’s just had enough of Rolf’s… antics. I agree with Kaplan.”</p>
            <p>Kaplan continued. “The same goes for the rest of you. We are here to do a job, and that job requires volunteers. Look at how much Hermann, Fielder, Schmidt, and Braun accomplished on their mission. If only the rest of you had their determination.” Kaplan shook his head slowly. “Unfortunately for me, none of you do.”</p>
            <p>Rolf’s half smirk turned into a scowl. He took a step towards Kaplan, leaving the safety of his group. His face was red, though Schmidt couldn’t tell if it was from embarrassment, rage, or the cold. “See, Raphael, you keep talking big, but what have <i>you</i> done that puts you above the rest of us? We’re out here risking our lives for the Empire and her citizens, and all we get in return is to be bossed around by you. At least <i>you</i> get a decent pay. We’re putting ourselves on the line, and for what? Protecting people we’ve never met? Keeping the <i>Empire</i> safe? You see, to me, the risk isn’t worth the reward.”</p>
            <p>Kaplan walked down the front steps of the church to meet Rolf. “You put your own life above the lives of others. You put your own life above the Empire. What have you done to earn it?”</p>
            <p>Rolf balled his fists, his knuckles white. “Good men died on those missions. You can insult me, but I won’t let you insult their memories. Some of those men were my friends. Are you saying their lives were worth less than some street urchin in Nuremberg?”</p>
            <p>Kaplan, less than a meter away from Rolf, kept eye contact with him. “From the moment they became soldiers, they knew they had the chance to die in battle. Dying to the Beans is an incredibly noble death. Those good men died for a good cause. Without them, we would never have gotten as far as we have. Our knowledge of the Beans now far surpasses our knowledge four months ago. Without their sacrifices, we never would have found a way to kill the Beans. Without their sacrifices, many more people than a single street urchin in Nuremberg would have needlessly died. Are you going to honor what they died for, or are you going to let their sacrifices be in vain? Are you going to let them die for nothing, or are you going to contribute something, for once in your <i>God damned</i> life?”</p>
            <p>Rolf narrowed his eyes, returning Kaplan’s eye contact. And then he laughed, though he remained tense. “Y’know, Raphael... you’ve changed. If you were always like this, maybe I would have even the <i>slightest</i> bit of respect for you. I volunteer for your stupid scouting mission.” Rolf turned to face the crowd. “Who’s joining me?”</p>
            <p>There was a moment of confused silence before three of Rolf’s friends slowly approached. Kaplan said “You are all dismissed, get back to your posts,” to the rest of the soldiers, then began giving Rolf’s group their mission briefing.</p>
            <p>The rest of the soldiers stood and waited for a moment, unsure if the meeting was actually over. It had been the quickest and most eventful meeting in the four months they had been in Besançon. Rob looked at Schmidt, Greg, and Marvin, and whispered “What the <i>hell</i> just happened?”</p>
            <p>Marvin replied “Rolf volunteered for the scouting mission.”</p>
            <p>Greg added “And Kaplan actually stood up to Rolf.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt said “Do you think Bösch or Krüger actually gave Kaplan that promotion he wanted when we were in Stuttgart? Maybe that’s why he’s been more confident recently.”</p>
            <p>“I sure hope he didn’t!” Rob replied. “We did all the work, we should’ve been the ones that got rewarded!”</p>
            <p>Marvin said “I don’t think he got a promotion. If he did, he wouldn’t stop talking about it.”</p>
            <p>“I mean, I was hoping he would change, but this is kind of extreme,” Schmidt said. “It’s a good thing he has a backbone now, though. It was getting a little sad watching him fail to get volunteers.”</p>
            <p>“Lemme guess, Barry,” Rob said, smiling. “You don’t wanna get on Kaplan’s bad side, now that he has the balls to raise his voice at you. First Krüger, now Kaplan… Bösch is the only officer you stand up to, isn’t he?”</p>
            <p>“Shut up, Rob.”</p>
            <p>“Either way,” Marvin said, “I think Rolf was right. About getting stuff done. I think Kaplan will be more strict from now on, and we might get some good information about the Beans because of that.”</p>
            <p>“It better not be us that finds more information. I don’t really wanna see a Bean again any time soon,” Rob said. He turned to Greg, who was staring at the ground, his brow furrowed. He patted Greg on the back. “Why so quiet, Gregory?”</p>
            <p>“I do not know…” Greg replied. “It just feels weird, does it not? I would have assumed that Kaplan would have gotten more reserved after our Bean encounter, not more aggressive.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe it finally made him realize that someone had to step up and be a leader.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe…”</p>
            <p>Marvin began walking in the direction of their barracks. The other soldiers had already left, leaving Rolf’s group organizing their supplies outside of the church. They were laughing heartily, one of the soldiers slapping Rolf on the back. “It’s getting cold. We should go,” Marvin said. They followed him in silence through the abandoned town, the only sound being that of the snow crunching softly under their feet.</p>
            <p>It had been three months since Besançon was abandoned. The citizens had been evacuated before they had time to gather their belongings. The market area near the center of the town had been left untouched by the soldiers, the fruit and meat having rotted past recognition months before, the cloth covers of the market stalls torn by the harsh weather.</p>
            <p>Various windows had been cracked or broken from the cold, the interiors of many buildings in the early stages of decay. Though the soldiers had been taking care of a small section of buildings near the eastern gate, the rest of the buildings in Besançon were not accustomed to the snow, and it was beginning to show.</p>
            <p>Schmidt wondered how long they would have to stay here. Hopefully they would be able to leave soon.</p>
            <p>“What’s wrong, Gregory?” Marvin asked quietly.</p>
            <p>Greg’s brow was still furrowed. “Something about what just happened feels wrong, but I can not put my finger on what it is exactly.”</p>
            <p>“People change,” Marvin replied.</p>
            <p>“He probably had enough of Rolf and decided to fight back for once,” Rob added.</p>
            <p>“I do not think that is what happened. I have been working under Kaplan the longest between the four of us, and in all the time I have known him, he has not acted like that. His response was… uncomfortably strong. Kaplan is not a strong man.”</p>
            <p>“What do you think, Barry?” Rob asked.</p>
            <p>“About what? Kaplan acting weird?”</p>
            <p>“Awfully suspicious, isn’t it? One minute, Kaplan is a timid rabbit, unable to stand up to anyone to save his life. Remember that time the meeting took four hours? And we just stood there, waiting for him to do something. But now, he’s going on about how important our job is and how happy we should be to do it. What’s changed, hmm?”</p>
            <p>“God, is this what I sounded like back in Dijon? I get why you were the only person that would talk to me for more than five minutes. You were the only one crazy enough to agree with me.”</p>
            <p>“Answer the question, Barry.”</p>
            <p>“I agree with you and Marvin. Kaplan probably got fed up with being pushed around by Rolf and decided to stand up for himself. He had a whole speech prepared, he’s probably been brainstorming it since we got back from Stuttgart.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe he tried asking Krüger for a promotion and got denied so hard that his entire personality changed.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe he heard about that Bean religion while we were in Stuttgart and thought it was about time to get serious about his job before something bad happened,” Schmidt said.</p>
            <p>“The Church of the Bean… something?” Greg said. “I heard about them from some of the other soldiers at the party. Weird people. They think the Beans are God, right?”</p>
            <p>Marvin replied “Yeah. The Church of the Beanmeister. They believe the Beans were sent by God Himself to cleanse the Earth and deliver the believers to Heaven.” He paused. “They worship a Bean creature called the Beanmeister, which I didn’t think much of at first, but it might be a type of abnormal Bean. We only know of the abnormal Crimson Bean, but abnormal versions of the Ashen and Emerald Beans are still unaccounted for.”</p>
            <p>“You sure know a lot about the Bean church, Marvin,” Rob said.</p>
            <p>“I heard about the Church at the party. The Empire thinks they’re a cult, and Captain Bösch talked about what they were doing to keep them in line. He doesn’t want zealots in Stuttgart during a crisis, especially not zealots that worship the Beans. I just thought it was interesting. I don’t know, maybe Kaplan joined it and got a confidence boost or something.”</p>
            <p>Greg made eye contact with Marvin, who immediately broke it. “If you believe Kaplan is a member of the Church of the Beanmeister, that is a very serious accusation.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt said “Hey, Marvin didn’t accuse Kaplan of anything. It was just a joke. I don’t think Kaplan would join a cult that the Empire is fighting against.”</p>
            <p>"Yeah,” Rob added. “He may be dumb, but he’s not that dumb. It makes more sense that he just got fed up with Rolf and we’re looking way too far into this. It’s not like he started doing blood sacrifices to the Bean master or anything.”</p>
            <p>“There haven’t been any reports of the Church of the Beanmeister performing sacrifices,” Marvin said.</p>
            <p>“You guys take everything way too seriously!” Rob replied. “We’re only <i>technically</i> at war! Lighten up a bit.” Rob laughed, but realized no one else was laughing with him, so quickly stopped.</p>
            <p>They finished the rest of their walk in silence.</p>
