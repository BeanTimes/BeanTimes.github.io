            <p>Sauer blinked. “That is bad. Very, very bad.”</p>
            <p>“Wow, you don’t say?” Schmidt replied.</p>
            <p>Sauer glared at Schmidt, holding back an insult and instead asking “So, what is that plan you wanted to tell me so badly?”</p>
            <p>“<i>My</i> plan? What do you mean, <i>my plan</i>? I don’t <i>have</i> a plan, that’s why I said we should talk about one! But you just wanted to talk about stuff we already knew, and now we’re out of time!” Schmidt, now visibly agitated, put his face in his hands. “We have what, an hour at most before they get in?”</p>
            <p>It made Sauer feel better to know that someone else was as worried as he was, though that did not alleviate his annoyance towards Schmidt. “We are not out of time just yet. We have at least enough time to come up with a plan before the Bean reinforcements arrive at the walls, and once they do, they may not even be able to breach the gates. There are still many unknowns, we---”</p>
            <p>Schmidt spoke, his defeated voice muffled by his hands as he slowly moved to sit on the ground. “We’re going to die here.”</p>
            <p>Sauer stopped. He finally began to realize just how hopeless their situation actually was. Meters away, he could hear the Beans still banging against the gate. He could hear the soldiers shooting their weapons and shouting commands at each other. The banging, the gunshots, the shouting; everything blended into one, terrifying droning in the background.</p>
            <p>It was obvious that they would all die in Dijon.</p>
            <p>Rob walked up behind Schmidt, putting a shaky hand on his shoulder. “Why the long face, Barry? This is exactly what you wanted, wasn’t it?” His voice was as unsteady as his hands, though he was able to force a wide smile. Looking at Sauer, he added “And don’t look too scared, sir. Everything will turn out fine! We just have to get out of this town, and everything will be fine.” His forced smile deepend.</p>
            <p>“This really isn’t the time, Rob.” Schmidt replied after a moment. “What are you doing here?”</p>
            <p>“You didn’t wave back, so I came looking for you and found you sitting on the ground with your face in your hands like some kinda hopeless failure. You’re not hopeless, though you being a failure is up for debate.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt ignored the comment. “There’s nothing we can do. We’ll be dead when those reinforcements arrive.”</p>
            <p>“That’s not something the Barry I know would say. What happened to wanting to make a tide turning sacrifice of the ages? To becoming a hero? Are you just gonna let yourself die here, sad and forgotten?”</p>
            <p>The ringing bell over the chapel slowly died down, though the dull thumping on the gates continued.</p>
            <p>“I’m not the same person as before.”</p>
            <p>“Like hell you are! Are you really gonna let some stupid, brain dead monsters get the better of you, the legendary Barnabas Schmidt? I’m sure when you heard there was a battle going on, you were happy something was finally happening. What’s changed since then?”</p>
            <p>“They’re called Beans now.” Schmidt replied, still ignoring Rob’s comments.</p>
            <p>“Are you kidding me? Letting Beans get the better of you is even worse than letting brain dead monsters get the better of you! Come on, man! At least go down fighting with me!”</p>
            <p>“How do you expect us to go down fighting? We can barely hurt them, how do you expect us to kill them.”</p>
            <p>“They move so slow it’s like shooting fish in a barrel!” Rob extended his hand toward Schmidt, who was still sitting on the ground, head in his hands. “Don’t you wanna at least help me kill some of those bastards? Shooting the cannons is actually pretty fun... Come on, Barry, we’re wasting valuable time here!”</p>
            <p>As Schmidt slowly removed his face from his hands, an idea began to slowly form in the back of Sauer’s mind. Schmidt reached up and grabbed Rob’s hand, replying “I always have wanted to shoot a cannon.”</p>
            <p>As Rob pulled Schmidt to his feet, he turned to Sauer and smiled. “I’m sure you can find a way to get us out of this town, sir.”</p>
            <p>Sauer replied “Why are you so sure? You do not know anything about me.”</p>
            <p>Rob smiled back. “Well, if I didn’t put my trust in someone, I’d have already given up. Barry seems to trust you. He trusted you enough to spend some of his last moments with you, so I’m gonna trust you too. Don’t let me down, sir. My life’s on the line, and I’m fairly fond of it.” With that, he forced a laugh and the two soldiers made their way towards the wall to fight. The idea in the back of Sauer’s mind formed into a fledgeling plan. But first, he would need to speak with Captain Bösch; his plan would require the help of every soldier in the town.</p>
            <p>As Sauer made his way towards St. Gotthard’s Chapel, the sounds of fighting rang throughout the empty streets. Though it was distant and much softer than the sounds of gun and cannonfire, the thumping from the Beans at the gates created a resonating, almost heartbeat-like echo.</p>
            <p>Sauer entered the chapel, seeing Captain Bösch, Wagner, Gladisch, and a small group of other soldiers holding a discussion around a table in the center of the nave. To his surprise, he noticed Adaline Reist, the fourth doctor stationed at Dijon who he assumed fled in the commotion this morning, also standing at the table.</p>
            <p>He approached silently, listening to the discussion. Wagner was speaking now, his stutter still noticeable. “We <i>must</i> defend the gates. We have no chance to fight those monsters, it would be best for us to wait until reinforcements arrive from Stuttgart! The gates are the weakest part of our defences, so we have to make sure none of the monsters get in!”</p>
            <p>Captain Bösch spoke now. “I understand your sentiment, Bernard, but I disagree. I feel that if we put all of our energy into defending the gates, we will be at a severe disadvantage if the monsters end up breaking in.”</p>
            <p>Another soldier spoke up. “Can we even count on reinforcements?”</p>
            <p>Bösch paused, then said “General Krüger gave me the command to prepare for battle with the monsters---”</p>
            <p>The same soldier interrupted him. “You’re telling me Krüger knew about these things? And he chose to keep everyone in the dark? There are soldiers that could still be alive if---”</p>
            <p>“FERDINAND. I know that this is a very difficult situation, but condemning our general is not what we should be doing right now. As I was saying, Krüger did know about the monsters, but from what I understand, we are not the only ones dealing with them right now. Knowing that, I do not think that it would be wise to expect reinforcements. Either we escape this city, or we hold it until we can escape. There is no hope of survival within these walls.”</p>
            <p>There was a pause, and Sauer cleared his throat loudly. Once he had everyone's attention, he clasped his hands in front of him, took a deep breath, and said “I think I know how we can escape these walls, Captain.”</p>
            <p>Immediately, everyone besides Gladisch, Reist, and Bösch began to ask him questions, their voices becoming one questioning drone. He could hear Wagner ask “What do you mean, Sauer?” as one of the soldiers he did not recognize said “There’s no hope, we’re just going to die here anyways.” and Ferdinand simply asked “Really?”</p>
            <p>“QUIET!” Captain Bösch boomed after a moment, silencing the others. “Let the man speak. We do not have time for this.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you captain.” Sauer finally replied once the talking had died down. “As I said, I know how we can get out of here, but it is risky, and really only just a theory.”</p>
            <p>Bösch chuckled softly. “Thomas, I assure you, a risky theory is more than we’ve come up with.”</p>
            <p>“Alright, then let me start from the beginning.” Sauer said, gathering his thoughts. “First and foremost, I will refer to the creatures caging us in Dijon as Beans. I will explain the reasoning behind the name if we escape the village, so do not make me waste time explaining it now. Second, the Beans are weak to cannonfire and are fairly slow. We will use these weaknesses to our advantage as we escape. Third, the Beans seem to be intelligent, though I am still unsure how the Beans are able to sense the world around them. If our theories are correct, then my plan should allow our forces to return east without any further casualties. If, however, our theories are incorrect, everyone in Dijon could die. Before we move on, does anyone have any questions?”</p>
            <p>Before anyone could respond, Bösch added “One at a time, please.”</p>
            <p>There was silence for a moment before Gladisch asked “How have you determined that these… Beans are intelligent?”</p>
            <p>“Based on the accounts of myself and a fellow soldier, I have come to the conclusion that the Beans planned the attack on Dijon and developed a strategy before their assault. This is based on the time of the attack, their strategic use of shadows and light to disorient and confuse our forces, and their coordinated movements during their initial assault. Also, Captain Bösch mentioned that other areas may be dealing with Bean attacks right now, which further credits my theory that they are intelligent. Any other questions?”</p>
            <p>Reist spoke immediately. “What is your theory about their senses?”</p>
            <p>Sauer was taken aback. He was not sure which shocked him the most; that in the nearly two years he had known Reist he was unsure that he had heard her talk, or the uncomfortable softness of her voice considering their current situation. “Our current theory is that the Beans are able to hear. Though we are unsure if they can see or not, it would be best to assume that they are able to see and plan accordingly.”</p>
            <p>After a moment of silence, Bösch asked “So, Thomas, what <i>is</i> your plan?”</p>
            <p>Sauer took another deep breath. “There’s a small stable a little outside the eastern wall, correct?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“And we are able to move the cannons anywhere in the city, given enough manpower and time.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t see why not.”</p>
            <p>“I propose we blast down the eastern gate with the cannons, killing the Beans blocking it, and use the horses from the stable to escape farther east. I assume there will not be enough horses for each soldier---”</p>
            <p>Wagner interrupted, his stuttering as pronounced now as it was on the battlefield. “Your plan is crazy! I’m sorry, Sauer, but I can’t just listen to you spout insanity like this! We would be much better off defending within the walls and waiting for reinforcements to arrive than attempt a suicide mission!”</p>
            <p>Wagner’s outburst sparked another frantic discussion in the group. Out of the ensuing chaos, Sauer was only able to pick out small segments of each argument and Bösch’s attempts to restore order to the discussion.</p>
            <p>“WHAT DID I SAY?” Bösch shouted, visibly annoyed. “ONE AT A TIME. WE WON’T GET ANYTHING DONE IF YOU KEEP DEVOLVING INTO ARGUMENTS LIKE CHILDREN. WE DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR THIS.” He took a deep breath. “Bernard. I understand what you’re trying to say. I really do, and if this was a normal situation, I would agree that we should defend within the walls until reinforcements arrive. However, this is not a normal situation. No reinforcements are coming to help us. Either we escape Dijon, be that through Thomas’ plan or another plan, or we die. It’s as simple as that.”</p>
            <p>One of the soldiers spoke up. “His plan is insane. There’s no possible way it could actually work. Blasting open the gate seems like an extreme that would only put us in more danger than it’s worth.”</p>
            <p>“What do you propose then, Matthias?” Bösch asked.</p>
            <p>“If we could just find a better way to exit the walls,” Matthias began, “this plan would make much more sense. Using the horses to escape is an excellent idea, and I would never have thought of it, but I still think it’s too risky to blast the gate open with the cannons. What if the wreckage blocks our escape? Or the gate doesn’t break completely and gets locked in place? What if debris harms our soldiers?”</p>
            <p>“Exactly!” Wagner exclaimed.</p>
            <p>Ferdinand said “I think that the risk is worth it. If we stay here, we risk the lives of all of our soldiers. At least with Thomas’ plan, we have the chance of some soldiers escaping alive.”</p>
            <p>The discussion quickly devolved back into argument. Bösch squeezed the bridge of his nose, Reist shook her head in annoyance, and Gladisch continued to sit in silence. Sauer was about to try and get everyone's attention when the bell above St. Gotthard’s Chapel began to ring again.</p>
            <p>A soldier ran down the stairs from the belltower. “Captain Bösch, there’s something you need to see. Come, quickly.”</p>
            <p>Bösch stood up with such force that his chair was knocked over. He rushed to the stairs, taking them two at a time. The people around the table were quiet now, their eyes wide with fear. Matthias muttered “Not again…”</p>
            <p>Sauer stood and followed Bösch up the stairs.</p>
            <p>For his stature, Bösch was surprisingly nimble. By the time Sauer reached the bottom of the stairs and began to follow, Bösch had already reached the top and was talking with the soldier that had summoned him. As Sauer reached the top of the stairs he heard Bösch say “---easily big enough to break down the gate… my God…”</p>
            <p>Sauer walked out onto the belltower’s platform. To the north and south, at least a hundred Beans were making their way steadily towards Dijon. They were no further than a kilometer away, though Bösch and the other three soldiers were gazing to the west.</p>
            <p>Lumbering from the forest near the improvised defences was a massive Bean monster.</p>
            <p>It was the largest creature Sauer had ever seen. He had heard stories of creatures from Africa, like elephants with their large, powerful bodies and giraffes with towering necks, though Sauer was sure no earthly creature could compare to the sheer size of the Bean monster withdrawing from the forest.</p>
            <p>The Bean monster was at least six meters tall, and equally as wide. It would easily tower over Dijon’s walls. It was made of the same dark red beans as the Beans surrounding the town. Its legs were short, perhaps only one meter tall. Its massie arms nearly dragged against the ground as it walked. It had no neck or head. In the center of its chest was a cavity that looked like a crater, at least a meter wide.</p>
            <p>It moved slowly, each step visibly shaking the trees around it.</p>
            <p>And it was moving steadily towards Dijon’s western gate.</p>
            <p>“You.” Bösch said, pointing towards one of the soldiers with them. “Go downstairs and tell them that we’re doing Thomas’ plan, and to work fast.” The soldier stared at Bösch, mouth agape. “GO!” The soldier quickly sprinted down the stairs.</p>
            <p>A rumbling roar came from the monster.</p>
            <p>Sauer’s throat was dry. “We will not be able to kill that... thing.”</p>
            <p>Bösch replied quietly, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I know… God damn it, I know…” He took a deep breath, turning back towards the Bean monster. “I know many of my men personally. This is no longer about me protecting our territory, or protecting the citizens of the Empire, or even fighting against these abominations for the greater good of humanity or any nonsense like that.” He paused, the Bean monster’s steps shaking the belltower slightly as it approached. “This is about me protecting my friends, my brothers in arms. I will not allow any more of my men to die. I would die ten times over before I allow another one of my friends to die. I hope your plan works, Thomas. It’s our only shot. May God help us.”</p>
            <p>With that, Captain Bösch returned to the nave of St. Gotthard’s Chapel.</p>
