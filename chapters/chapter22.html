                December 8th, 1587 - Stuttgart, Holy Roman Empire

            <div id="div-line-long"></div>
            <h3>
                The first confirmed sightings of both drone and abnormal Beans happened on October 5th, 1587, though it is all but confirmed that the Beans originated in Paris in the summer of 1586. It is not known for how long the Beans existed before they attacked Paris, or if the attack was strategic or purely random. Based on increasing evidence of Bean intelligence, it makes sense that the attack on Paris was strategic, though there are many more areas that were better suited for an initial attack.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Sauer had read the report more times than he could count, and he still could not make sense of it. The report described a routine scouting mission held between November 28th and December 1st, in which four soldiers entered Bean territory in search of information which could be used by the Holy Roman Army. The soldiers returned claiming to have encountered an immobile Bean in the French countryside; the first sighting of a Bean since the initial attack two months before.</p>
            <p>The report arrived in Stuttgart on December 4th, stating that the soldiers and their commanding officer would arrive in Stuttgart on December 8th to report their findings. General Krüger was alerted immediately, arriving from Nuremberg early on the morning of December 8th. He decided to hold the meeting in the nave of St. Nicholas’ Church, near Stuttgart’s military headquarters, as he determined no rooms in the headquarters would be suitable to accommodate the number of people that he wanted to listen to the report.</p>
            <p>Three tables were set in the shape of a U, facing towards the entrance of the church, each holding twenty people. Sauer, Reist, and Schubert sat at the table on the left with a group of other doctors who were also studying the Beans. Sauer had never met any of them before, though he assumed that they had also been hand picked by General Krüger for their intelligence and determination. The other doctors kept to themselves, reviewing the report of the scouting mission that had been given to everyone present at the church.</p>
            <p>General Krüger and a group of other high ranking military personnel sat at the front table, talking quietly with each other. It was the first time Sauer had seen General Krüger, who reminded him of his friend Hoffmann in Nuremberg. Krüger was much taller than Sauer and built like a warrior, his hair and full beard meticulously kept. Captain Bösch looked smaller than usual next to Krüger, reviewing the report of the scouting mission. The table on the right seated military tacticians, who had been creating theories and strategies on how to fight the Beans, though they had made very little progress, due to the lack of information.</p>
            <p>Sauer sighed and flipped through the report again. If the report was factual and the Beans really did have human corpses inside of them, then that would change everything that they knew about the Beans and would only add to the increasing amount of unanswered questions they needed to solve if they wanted any semblance of a chance against them.</p>
            <p>Schubert leaned towards Sauer, reading the report over his shoulder. “Anything new on that report, Thomas my boy?”</p>
            <p>“I just want to make sure I understand everything before the meeting starts. This could hold the information we need to begin a counterattack against the Beans.”</p>
            <p>Reist, who sat on the other side of Sauer, said “Leon, you should be taking this more seriously. The information on this report puts everything we thought we knew about the Beans into---”</p>
            <p>“I know, silly, but reading the report over and over won’t give you any more information! Just wait until those soldiers get here, and then we can ask the important questions.”</p>
            <p>“And what, exactly, would those questions be?”</p>
            <p>Schubert smiled, glancing to the side to make sure no one was listening before leaning even closer to Sauer and whispering “If the Beans really are dead people.”</p>
            <p>“Leon, stop it,” Reist said. “I don’t want to think about what that would mean...”</p>
            <p>“Well, we’re going to have to think about it if this report is true, Adaline,” Schubert replied. “I’m sorry, but we have to know everything about them if we want any chance at defeating them, and them being dead people certainly seems like something we would have to know.”</p>
            <p>Sauer put his hand softly on Reist’s shoulder. Her eyes were distant as she stared at the report in front of her. He was thinking of how to console her when the door at the front of the church opened, a single soldier entering. He walked down the center of the church, stopping in front of Krüger. They spoke quietly, and the soldier exited the church. After a moment, the church’s door opened wide and a group of soldiers walked in.</p>
            <p>“Oh my God,” Sauer muttered as Lieutenant Kaplan, Schmidt, Rob, and two other soldiers entered the church, surrounded by guards from Stuttgart for protection.</p>
            <p>Reist narrowed her eyes. “Weren’t those two in Dijon with us? And that’s the officer we met in Besançon… those other two look familiar as well, but I don’t remember where we met them.”</p>
            <p>Schubert smiled. “You’re telling me you know <i>all</i> of those guys?”</p>
            <p>Sauer watched as the guards escorted Kaplan’s soldiers to the center of the church, facing General Krüger’s table, before exiting the church. Kaplan looked around in awe; he was standing in front of dozens of the highest ranked officers in the Holy Roman Army.</p>
            <p>“Please state your name and rank, and the names of your men,” Krüger said. His voice was calm.</p>
            <p>“Uh…” Kaplan began, “Kaplan. I mean, Lieutenant. Lieutenant Kaplan.” He introduced Schmidt, Rob, and the two soldiers Sauer did not recognize. Schmidt and Rob were nervous, while Gregory Herrmann looked confidently around the church, basking in the attention, and Marvin Braun was even more anxious than Wagner used to be.</p>
            <p>Wagner...</p>
            <p>The events of Dijon rushed over him. Wagner among the wreckage of the western wall, the man Reist was with dying in front of her, Gladisch saving lives but unable to save her own, the belltower of St. Gotthard’s Chapel crumbling as though it was made of sand, the massive Bean creature’s attacks shredding---</p>
            <p>“Please explain in detail what you saw during your scouting mission in Bean territory,” Krüger said.</p>
            <p>Sauer blinked. His heart was beating fast. He felt distant. He had to think about where he was. He was... in Stuttgart, in a meeting about the Beans. He was not in Dijon. He would never return to Dijon, for Dijon was in Bean territory.</p>
            <p>He was safe. For now, at least.</p>
            <p>“Uh, actually, I wasn’t there, so…” Kaplan said, turning towards Greg. “Mr. Herrmann, if you would please explain… what you saw, on your mission. Your---”</p>
            <p>Greg took a step forward. “Myself, Robert Fiedler, Barnabas Schmidt, and Marvin Braun left our post in Besançon around midday on November 28th. We estimated that our trip would take one week in total, and our goal was to find any information that would be useful in fighting the Beans. We passed the ruins of Dijon on the afternoon of the 28th, and continued---”</p>
            <p>“Please describe the ruins of Dijon,” Krüger said.</p>
            <p>Schubert leaned toward Sauer. “He talks weird, don’t you think?”</p>
            <p>“Please, Schubert. I’m trying to focus on the report,” Sauer replied.</p>
            <p>Greg continued. “We did not investigate thoroughly, as we determined that it would be far too dangerous and potentially put our mission in jeopardy, though we did notice that Dijon was devoid of… corpses.” Whispers broke out among the crowd. “Schmidt and Rob were in Dijon on the day of the Bean attack, so they were able to confirm that the corpses were not where they should have been. No skeletons, no remains, no traces of anyone. We also did not notice any Beans inside Dijon, but we can’t be sure since we did not enter the village ourselves. Besides the missing corpses, Schmidt and Rob felt as though the ruins hadn’t been touched, by either Beans or humans.”</p>
            <p>Missing corpses. He glanced at Reist, who sat unmoving next to him. She was still looking at the report in front of her, though her eyes were unfocussed.</p>
            <p>Krüger nodded as he listened. “Please, continue.”</p>
            <p>“The rest of the 28th and 29th passed uneventfully. We set up small camps, and did not see any signs of the Beans on both nights. On the afternoon of November 30th, a few hours before we were planning to begin our return journey, we noticed a Bean standing in the middle of a field. After determining that it was safe to advance, we approached the Bean cautiously. It seemed to be frozen in place, paralyzed or otherwise unable to move. Schmidt decided to investigate the Bean thoroughly.” Greg turned toward Schmidt. “Would you please report what you saw?”</p>
            <p>Schmidt stepped forward. He glanced at the military table at the front of the church before turning to the table to his right. “The type of Bean we saw was a Crimson Bean, the same type that attacked Dijon. I was curious about how its shell worked, so after we determined that it was no threat to us, I inspected it.”</p>
            <p>“Please explain how you determined that the Bean was not a threat,” Krüger said.</p>
            <p>Rob spoke. “I threw Schmidt’s helmet at it and it didn’t move.”</p>
            <p>Schubert stifled a laugh. “I like that guy.”</p>
            <p>“Yeah,” Schmidt said. “It didn’t respond as we approached on horseback, didn’t respond when it was hit with my helmet, and didn’t respond as I approached it on foot, so I determined that it would be no threat. The Bean was made of a bunch of small, reddish ovals that looked similar to certain species of beans, each one surrounded by a thick white liquid that kind of looked like puss. After inspecting it up close, I now understand where the name ‘Bean’ came from. It was slightly thicker than a normal person; its limbs were wider even though it was an average height. It did not have any hair or genitals, and its shell wasn’t as flat as it looked from a distance, probably so it can manipulate its shell to attack. It smelled horrible, like rotting meat, and was cold to the touch.” Schmidt paused then turned to Greg, who stepped forward and began to speak again.</p>
            <p>“After Schmidt investigated the Bean, we decided to try and see what was under the Bean’s shell. We learned that...” Greg paused for a moment. He took a deep breath, then continued. “We learned that the Beans are human corpses, covered by a shell of beans.”</p>
            <p>Silence. It took a moment for everyone in the church to process what they had heard. So it <i>was</i> true. The Beans <i>were</i> humans.</p>
            <p>Whispers began between two tacticians at the table on the right. To Sauer’s left, a group of doctors began discussing how it could be possible. One of the doctors stood up, asking Greg “What was the state of the body?” Two tacticians asked questions over one another. Kaplan’s soldiers looked around the church frantically, unsure of what to do. Krüger sat silently as officers around him devolved into argument. Bösch tugged at the ends of his mustache nervously. Next to Sauer, Reist covered her mouth as her eyes fell to her lap.</p>
            <p>“Now things are starting to get interesting, don’t you think?” Schubert said, nudging Sauer in the ribs. “I don’t know what I was expecting the Beans to be, but it sure wasn’t people!”</p>
            <p>Sauer looked at the report again. He could not believe it before, and he still could not believe it now. But it was true.</p>
            <p>The Beans were humans.</p>
            <p>General Krüger cleared his throat loudly. “Please, everyone calm down.” Once there was silence, he asked Greg “Does that conclude your report?”</p>
            <p>Greg replied “Yeah, that was everything we---”</p>
            <p>Marvin interrupted him, speaking barely above a whisper. “The beans.”</p>
            <p>“What about the Beans? I’m positive that I covered everything we know… right?” Greg asked, turning to his fellow soldiers. Rob shrugged, and Schmidt glanced at Kaplan, who was still staring at the front table in awe, unaffected by the revelation that the Beans were humans.</p>
            <p>Marvin repeated himself. “The beans. In the jar. The sample we brought back.”</p>
            <p>General Krüger’s eyes narrowed. “A sample? What kind of sample? There was no reference of a sample in your report.”</p>
            <p>Marvin paused, his eyes hidden by his hair. “Was… I the only one that remembered that we took a sample? Before we found out that the Beans had people inside of them...”</p>
            <p>A look of recognition crossed the other three soldiers’ faces. Greg smiled. “Ah, yes! The sample Schmidt took. Thank you for reminding us Marvin, that sample will be immensely valuable in future Bean research!”</p>
            <p>Rob looked at Marvin and smiled guiltily. “Yeah, sorry, I completely forgot about that. The whole corpse in the Bean thing really took my mind off---”</p>
            <p>General Krüger stood up, booming “Lieutenant Kaplan, please explain why you did not feel it necessary to report that you obtained a sample of the Beans.”</p>
            <p>Kaplan jumped, avoiding Krüger’s eyes. “Well, uh, General… my soldiers, they didn’t inform me of this, either. I’m just as surprised as you are… My apologies, for any inconvenience this may have caused you...”</p>
            <p>As Kaplan spoke, Marvin removed a small item wrapped in parchment from his pocket. Krüger, who had sat back down, motioned for Marvin to bring the item to the front table, and he hesitantly complied. Marvin placed the item on the table and returned to the center of the church, his eyes cast downward.</p>
            <p>Krüger studied the item in front of him, then glanced around the church. Everyone was staring at him expectantly; even Reist had looked up from her report.</p>
            <p>He slowly began to unwrap the parchment.</p>
            <p>As the parchment fell, it revealed a small glass jar that was filled with beans. Krüger held it above the table, his eyes narrowing as he focussed on the beans inside. They were tightly packed together, some crushed against the side, rotting fluid spilling to the bottom of the jar. Krüger rotated it in his hands to get a better look at the beans, which had seemingly begun to move inside the jar.</p>
            <p>Sauer chuckled slightly to himself as he rubbed his eyes. There was no way the beans in the jar were moving. If they were, that would change everything they thought they knew about the Beans. That would be a more important discovery than finding out that human corpses were inside the Beans. They would have to change what they assumed the Beans were, reassess how they thought the Beans worked. Using corpses to move was one thing, something that Sauer could understand given enough time to process, but the beans in the jar moving on their own is something that he wasn’t sure he could understand. He swallowed as he returned his gaze to the jar.</p>
            <p>The beans were definitely moving.</p>
            <p>Immediately, discussion broke out among the people in the church. Reist jumped slightly next to Sauer, and Schubert giggled to himself. A group of guards behind the front table gathered around Krüger for protection, who put up a casual hand to stop them. The doctors farthest from the beans in the jar moved closer to get a better look. Through the chaos, Sauer heard Rob shout “They weren’t moving when we took them off the Bean, we swear!”</p>
            <p>General Krüger placed the jar on the table, standing up to his full height. He took a deep breath, a smile crossing his face, though his eyes did not share the enthusiasm of his voice. “This is excellent news! This may be just the advantage we needed to finally strike back against the Beans!” He turned to a soldier behind him. “Please bring this sample to the doctor's quarters, and be very, very careful.” His eyes fell to the doctor’s table next. “I expect research to begin first thing tomorrow morning. In the meantime, however, I feel we must finish asking these brave soldiers about their experience with the Bean in the field. There is still so much that has yet to be determined about the enemy!”</p>
            <p>The soldier behind Krüger complied, returning the jar to the parchment and quickly exiting the church. A few doctors and tacticians followed, eager at their first chance to see the Beans up close.</p>
            <p>As the commotion in the church died down, Kaplan’s soldiers sighed in relief. After a moment, Greg said “Are there any specific questions you would like to ask?”</p>
            <p>Sauer stood up before anyone else had a chance to speak. “You said that the beans, the sections of shell, I mean, were immobile when you took them off the paralyzed Bean in the field, correct?”</p>
            <p>Schmidt noticed Sauer and Reist for the first time and smiled, replying “Yeah. They didn’t even move when I picked them up, which made me think that they had died somehow.”</p>
            <p>“You picked them up? Was there anything between you and the beans when you touched them? How, exactly, did they feel in your hands?”</p>
            <p>“There wasn’t anything between my fingers and the beans, which, looking back, probably wasn’t the smartest thing to do. They felt… weirdly cold, I guess. Even though it was cold where we found it, they seemed to be much cooler than the air. The individual beans were hard, but the shell itself wasn’t solid… closer to a thick mud than flesh.”</p>
            <p>Rob added “Since they aren’t really solid, and they are able to move by themselves in the jar, maybe that’s how they were able to move parts of their shells around to attack.”</p>
            <p>Sauer sat down, stunned. He had no idea what any of this could mean, but he could tell that it was important. Very important. He took his journal out from his pocket and wrote down what he learned.</p>
            <p>On the other side of the church, a tactician began asking Greg a question. Schubert glanced over Sauer’s shoulder and read as he wrote. “Cold, able to move shell, human corpses, how are they connected. Wow, your question marks are really cute, Thomas, but you need to work on your handwriting. I can barely read any of that. And is that a drawing of a Bean in the corner? I haven’t seen any in person, so I wouldn’t know.”</p>
            <p>“How are these connected?” Sauer asked himself, ignoring Schubert. “They have to be connected somehow, but how? And why? What is the significance of human corpses? When they attacked me in Dijon, I could feel that they were hot, I am sure of it… perhaps they use body heat to move? No, that would only make sense if the people were alive… But the people inside the Bean were dead before they were covered with beans, so they could not use body heat to move. If they needed body heat, they would not have suffocated the soldiers in Dijon. And the missing corpses proves that they <i>are</i> using dead humans, and not only living humans that were covered in beans…”</p>
            <p>Schubert’s eyes lit up. “Hey, hey, I just realized! If the Beans are using human corpses, then does that mean they can use animal corpses too? Imagine a horse covered in beans. That would be pretty cool, wouldn’t it? A Bean cavalryman would be interesting to see. Do you think it would have a bean spear?”</p>
            <p>In the center of the church, Schmidt was responding to a question Krüger had asked him.</p>
            <p>Reist put her hand to her mouth. “Thomas, wait.”</p>
            <p>“Yes?”</p>
            <p>“I think I figured it out.”</p>
            <p>Sauer stared at her.</p>
            <p>“If the Beans that attacked us in Dijon were hot, and the Bean paralyzed in the field was cold, then that would mean the Beans need heat to move.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I already assumed that.”</p>
            <p>“But think about when the Beans attacked.”</p>
            <p>“October 5th. Two months ago. Where are you going with this?”</p>
            <p>“What if the attacks on October 5th were strategic?”</p>
            <p>Schubert said “It’s rude to answer a question with a question, silly. Now get to the point, I’m on the edge of my seat over here!”</p>
            <p>“I’m sorry, but I agree with Schubert.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you, Thomas my boy.”</p>
            <p>Reist sighed. “What I’m getting at is, and I know this sounds insane, but what if the Beans are only able to move when it’s above a certain temperature outside, and not by using the heat they produce themselves, or body heat from humans, or something like that? And the reason they attacked the Empire’s western front on October 5th wasn’t to get more corpses for their army or to begin a war with humanity or anything. What if it was just to buy time? What if the Beans knew the Empire was preparing to move west, and they anticipated it and attacked the Empire to prevent them from advancing on Bean territory over the winter.”</p>
            <p>“I am sorry, but you lost me.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t think the Beans can move during the winter. They attacked us to make sure that we wouldn’t---”</p>
            <p>General Krüger stood up, motioning to Kaplan’s soldiers and speaking so loud it put Bösch to shame. “If that is all the questions we have, then I would like to thank you men for bringing us this information. This was exactly what we needed! The ride from Nuremberg has made me tired, but this excellent news has put me in an even better mood! I propose we host a party to celebrate this historic advancement in Bean knowledge, and begin planning to advance on Bean territory once we learn all we can from the bean sample brought to us by these brave men.”</p>
            <p>Kaplan and his soldiers stood in the center of the church, confused. They were not expecting a party.</p>
            <p>Reist rubbed her temples. “We can talk about this later. I’ll have to keep thinking about it… Sorry.”</p>
            <p>Bösch turned to Krüger, speaking for the first time in the meeting. “What do you mean, you want to throw a party?”</p>
            <p>“What I mean, Humbert, that I want to celebrate!”</p>
