                To those who have survived: I write this now, for I fear my death is imminent.

            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Thomas Sauer was tired of the rumors. He had spent his whole day inside again, working with his patients while they talked about all of the rumors from Paris. Rumors of monsters roaming the streets at night, or the dead returning to life around the city, new rumors sprung up nearly every day since the news about the outbreak of the disease reached Nuremberg last month. Of course, with Sauer being a doctor, he could easily see that it was just a resurgence of the plague that had ravaged Europe off and on for centuries. Though the worst of it had happened long before he was born, there had still been numerous reports throughout the years of some towns and villages in the Holy Roman Empire experiencing small outbreaks. The solution was simple; continue to avoid Paris and the affected areas, and it will eventually go away like it always has. Of course, those infected will die and times would be tough in the Kingdom of France for a short while, but it was a cost they needed to pay to save the rest of Europe from a serious outbreak.</p>
            <p>Sauer thought about the rumors as he walked through the streets of Nuremberg, the capital city of the Holy Roman Empire, leaving his inherited medical practice for the night. The sun had already set, leaving the city shrouded in the flickering shadows from the lanterns hanging above the main streets. Sauer’s house was in the opposite direction, deeper in the city, though he was not heading there just yet. Tonight, he was going to meet a friend.</p>
            <p>Sauer moved confidently through the dark streets, making his way into the Black Eagle Tavern. As he opened the door, he was met with the soft flickering of candlelight, the smell of alcohol, and the usual incoherent evening discourse. He was not usually one to drink, but he thought he deserved one after his long month of listening to rumors. That, and his practice was closed on Saturdays and Sundays, so he could afford to get drunk tonight.</p>
            <p>He walked to his usual table, noticing that his friend was already waiting, half a glass of beer sitting on the table in front of him. “Evening, Sauer.” The man said curtly, his speech slurred slightly. Perhaps he had already drunk more than half a glass of beer while he waited.</p>
            <p>“How have you been, Hoffmann?” Sauer replied. Albert Hoffmann was a large man both physically and emotionally. His intimidating stature and booming voice helped propel him through the ranks of the Nuremberg city guard, and eventually get him a job protecting the city and the surrounding areas with the Empire government itself. He frequented the Black Eagle enough when he was not working that some patrons thought he had been hired to prevent fights in the tavern. That was not true however; Hoffmann was merely a man who liked his beer. Sauer pulled out a chair and sat down next to him.</p>
            <p>“Oh, you know. The new rumors about Paris, or at least what everyone <i>thinks</i> has happened, has still been keeping the big guys busy.” Hoffmann began. “It’s annoying, screwing up all my actually important work here in the city. Some people are panicking here about some disease hundreds of kilometers away. It started over a year ago, for Christ’s sake! Just making all my work more difficult, I can’t wait for all this to be over…” He moved the half empty glass to his lips.</p>
            <p>“From what I understand, it is simply a resurgence of the plague. As long as traders continue to avoid Paris, the Empire has nothing to worry about. Surely Nuremberg will have nothing to worry about. Though I do think it is a bit much to restrict trade through France, at least the Empire is being careful about it.”</p>
            <p>“That’s exactly what I’ve been telling them! But no, they want me to scour the city for doctors willing to put themselves at risk to study a disease that has nothing to do with us. Only an idiot would actually go.”</p>
            <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“I mean that it’s stupid for us to waste time and resources trying to study something that can be so easily avoided! Just let it fade itself out like---”</p>
            <p>“No, no, what do you mean when you say the Empire wants to study it?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, that. Well, they recently got this idea to send doctors to see exactly what’s going on in Paris, and even some other areas of France; apparently there were recently some other minor outbreaks farther west. That’s why the rumors have gotten more plentiful recently, I think. Anyways, they either wanna get to the bottom of all the stupid rumors, or they don’t want the trading to slow down. The trading thing is understandable, the French buy an ungodly amount of wool from us, but if they just wanna know what all the rumors are about, I could easily tell them. It’s just the old housewives making a bigger deal of something than simply need be! And now I have to do my job and everyone else's jobs, too!”</p>
            <p>“Who knows? Maybe there actually is something more to it, but I do not have any idea of what that could be. And I know that you are going to try and ask me at some point, so I will just tell you now: my practice has been unusually busy lately thanks to the rumors, so I will not be able to volunteer my time to study the outbreak. It is funny; my patients think they are going to get sick by even discussing Paris.”</p>
            <p>Hoffmann looked at his now empty glass dejectedly. “Ah, at least you’re getting something out of it. Thanks, anyways.”</p>
            <p>“No need to be so down, Hoffmann. Let me buy you another drink, and maybe we could talk about something more cheerful than the potential deaths of thousands and a monetary loss to the Empire that could damage the economy for years to come.”</p>
            <p>“You know, I can never tell when you’re joking.”</p>
            <p>“You should know by now that I never joke.”</p>
            <p>“Was that a joke?”</p>
            <p>“Was it?”</p>
            <p>Hoffmann looked confused for a moment, then changed the subject to something more cheerful. Before Sauer realized, most of the regulars at the tavern had left, leaving him, Hoffmann, and the other late night stragglers that had no reason to leave sitting the cozy, candlelit tavern. Finishing his last drink, Sauer stood up to leave, apologizing again to Hoffmann about Paris and his work.</p>
            <p>“Why’re you apologizing?” Hoffmann replied, his speech now noticeably slurred. “It’s not your fault this empire doesn’t know how to run itself. If they keep this up, we won’t be able to last much longer!”</p>
            <p>And with that closing remark, Hoffmann got up and drunkenly stumbled towards the exit of the Black Eagle Tavern, eventually reaching the dark streets of the city outside. Sauer watched Hoffmann stumble into the dark, turned the opposite direction, and began to make his way towards his house.</p>
            <p>As he walked, his thoughts were drawn to what Hoffmann had said about how the Empire was handling the situation in Paris, and apparently other areas of France. At first, he had assumed it was simply a resurgence of the Plague and dismissed all the panic as frivolous, and that there was little for the Empire to actually worry about. However, Hoffmann had said some things tonight that made him think otherwise. Something about the way the Empire was handling the situation gnawed at Sauer, but he could not put his finger on what, exactly, was bothering him.</p>
            <p>He arrived at his house deep in the night, though this was not unusual for him. He had left a candle, firesteel, and a small stone by his front door to light when he entered. The soft candlelight cast dancing shadows on the walls of Sauer’s house.</p>
            <p>Sauer lived alone, his house quiet and empty. He was full from his time at the tavern with Hoffmann, and utterly exhausted from his day working at his practice. Sauer placed the lit candle on the table next to his unmade bed, along with his circular eyeglasses, and fell in a deep, dreamless sleep before his head hit the pillow. </p>
