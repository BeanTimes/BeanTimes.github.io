                Sauer - July 13th, 1585 - Nuremberg, Holy Roman Empire
            </h2>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>



            <p>Thomas Sauer was tired of the rumors. He had spent his whole day inside again, working with his patients while they talked about all of the rumors from Paris. “I heard this,” and “He said that,” nearly every day since the news about the outbreak of the disease reached Nuremberg over a year ago. Of course, with Sauer being a doctor, he could easily see that it was just a resurgence of the plague that had ravished Europe off and on for centuries. Though the worst of it had happened long before he was born, there had still been numerous reports throughout the years of some towns and villages in the Holy Roman Empire experiencing small outbreaks. The solution was simple; continue to avoid Paris, and it will eventually go away like it always has. Of course, those infected will die and times would be tough in the Kingdom of France, but it was a cost they needed to pay to save the rest of Europe from a serious outbreak.</p>

            <p>Sauer thought about the rumors as he walked through the streets of Nuremberg, the capital city of the Holy Roman Empire, leaving his inherited private medical practice for the night. The sun had already set, leaving the city shrouded in the flickering shadows of the lanterns hanging above the main streets. Sauer’s house was deeper in the city, though he was not heading there just yet. He was going to meet a friend.</p>

            <p>Sauer moved confidently through the dark streets, making his way into the Black Eagle Tavern. As he opened the door, he was met with the soft flickering of candlelight, the smell of alcohol, and the usual incoherent evening discourse. He was not usually one to drink, but he thought he deserved one after his long week. That, and his practice was closed on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>

            <p>He walked to his usual table, noticing that his friend was already waiting, half a glass of beer sitting on the table in front of him. “Evening, Sauer.” The man said curtly. His name was Albert Hoffmann, a large man both physically and emotionally. His intimidating stature and booming voice helped propel him through the ranks of the Nuremberg city guard, and eventually get him a job protecting the city and the surrounding areas with the Empire government itself. He frequented the Black Eagle enough when he was not working that some patrons thought he had been hired to prevent fights in the tavern. That was false however, Hoffmann was merely a man who liked his beer. Sauer pulled out a chair and sat down next to him, replying “How have you been, Hoffmann?”</p>

            <p>Hoffmann’s speech was slurred slightly. Maybe he had drunk more than half a glass of beer while he waited. “Oh, you know. The new rumors about Paris, or at least what everyone thinks has happened, has been keeping the big guys busy.” Hoffmann began. “It’s annoying, screwing up all my actually important work here in the city. Some people are panicking here about some disease hundreds of kilometers away over a year ago, for Christ’s sake! Just making all my work more difficult…” He moved the half empty glass to his lips.</p>

            <p>“From what I understand, it is simply a resurgence of the plague. As long as traders continue to avoid Paris, the Empire has nothing to worry about. Surely Nuremberg will have nothing to worry about. Though, I do think it is a bit much to restrict trade through western France, at least the Empire is being careful about it.”</p>

            <p>“That’s exactly what I’ve been telling them! But no, they want me to scour the city for doctors willing to put themselves at risk to study a disease that has nothing to do with us. Only an idiot would actually go.”</p>
