            <h3>
                This assumption is only based on our current knowledge of the Beans and our fledgling theory that the Beans are attempting to achieve some unknown goal. For all we know, the Beans are merely hunting humanity to extinction for sport. In any case, we have only known about the Beans for a few months, while they have been conquering our territory for more than a year, in which they have potentially wiped out three of the most powerful empires of our time.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Schmidt whistled as he followed Kaplan into Stuttgart’s military headquarters. The high ceilings and open rooms were much more impressive than the buildings Schmidt had become used to in Dijon and Besançon. One wall was lined with a series of beautiful wooden doors leading to a central garden, the other walls holding smaller doors leading to hallways deeper within the headquarters and large paintings of previous army officers and emperors.</p>
            <p>Schmidt wasn’t prepared for a party, and it didn’t seem like anyone else was, either. Kaplan and his soldiers wore the same clothes they had worn to the report presentation; Empire supplied clothes and armor matching their respective ranks. The dozens of other people standing around the building wore similarly informal clothes, talking among each other as though they were not in the middle of a secure military headquarters.</p>
            <p>Or on the brink of a hopeless war against the Beans.</p>
            <p>Schmidt shook his head, pushing those thoughts away. He had earned this party, no matter how unexpected it was. He might as well enjoy it.</p>
            <p>Kaplan looked around the building with awe. “There are so many officers here…”</p>
            <p>“One might expect that of a military headquarters,” Greg said.</p>
            <p>“Do you think they’ll promote me for this? We’re the reason they’re having this party in the first place, right? I need to find General Krüger, he’ll definitely--- look at all the food! The smell alone is enough to drive a man crazy with anticipation! I’ve been living off of rations for months now, I can’t wait to eat!” As Kaplan began walking to a long table filled with different types of meats and cheeses, he said “Don’t embarrass me while I’m gone, guys.”</p>
            <p>“You have our word!” Greg called back.</p>
            <p>“Don’t forget to find Krüger, Lieutenant!” Schmidt added. “This is your chance!”</p>
            <p>“What could we even do to embarrass him?” Marvin asked.</p>
            <p>“Dunno,” Rob said as he glanced around the room. “I think it would be rude if we attempted a coup or something, that would probably embarrass him.”</p>
            <p>“I know you’re joking, Rob, but don’t say that too loud,” Schmidt said. “Krüger didn’t seem like the kind of person that would take something like that lightly. Honestly, he kind of scares me...”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rob replied, still looking around the room. Many of the soldiers and army officials scattered around the room were tall, so Rob had to stand on his toes to get a good view. Schmidt recognized some of them from their report the day before, but no one approached them to ask about their experience in Bean territory.</p>
            <p>“Who are you looking for?” Greg asked.</p>
            <p>“I wanted to talk with Mr. Sauer about the Beans,” Rob replied as he began climbing onto a chair to get a better look.</p>
            <p>“I think that is exactly the kind of thing Kaplan asked us not to do,” Marvin mumbled.</p>
            <p>“Why do you want to talk to him, of all people?” Schmidt asked as he took the chair from Rob, returning it to the table he had taken it from.</p>
            <p>“Well, I think he’d be able to make use of the information we found,” Rob said. “His plan got us out of Dijon, after all, and he’s tied for the most experienced person on the Beans with the other survivors of Dijon.”</p>
            <p>“I guess that’s true, but there are so many better people we could talk to here. I’m sure there are plenty of women here that would love to talk to a survivor of Dijon.”</p>
            <p>“I’m sure they would, but they can wait. And I actually kinda liked Mr. Sauer. He was really nice, patching up my arm for me and, you know, saving our sorry lives from the Beans. I seem to remember you giving up when faced with even the slightest bit of danger.”</p>
            <p>“And I seem to remember you being so scared of the Beans that you couldn’t hold your musket steady.”</p>
            <p>“Well I seem to remember---”</p>
            <p>“If you two are going to argue, at least come up with some creative insults,” Greg said. “Now, what does this Mr. Sauer character look like, then?”</p>
            <p>Rob replied. “He’s tall, got circular glasses, dark hair.”</p>
            <p>“Scary face,” Schmidt added.</p>
            <p>“Yeah, scary face too. Just imagine a doctor and you’ll probably be pretty close.”</p>
            <p>“Do you know if he’ll be with anyone?” Greg asked.</p>
            <p>Schmidt replied. “Yeah, he’ll probably be with that woman doctor from Dijon. She was with him when we presented our report. What was her name again?”</p>
            <p>“Reist,” Rob replied. “She’s blonde, average height, wears her hair in a bun.”</p>
            <p>“Is that them?” Marvin asked, pointing at a group of people in the back corner of the room holding small plates of food. Among them were Sauer and Reist, each holding a glass of wine.</p>
            <p>“That’s them all right,” Rob replied, walking towards them.</p>
            <p>“I’ll be right with you,” Greg said. “Kaplan was right, this food does look really good, and I’m starving.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt followed Greg to the food table, saying. “I haven’t eaten anything today to prepare for this. The military is supposed to get the finest food in the Empire.”</p>
            <p>Marvin said something quietly, then followed Rob to the back of the room.</p>
            <p>Greg made his way to the cheese section of the table, while Schmidt eyed the meat section. He could recognize some of the meat, steamed chicken, beef, and duck, but there was even more that he didn’t recognize, and it all smelled amazing. He licked his lips as he piled new meat onto his plate.</p>
            <p>Once he was done, he saw that Greg had finished and begun to make his way to meet Sauer and Rob when two impressively strong hands gripped his shoulders. Schmidt felt his stomach drop.</p>
            <p>Humbert Bösch’s voice was barely above a whisper. “Do not trust anyone here, Barnabas. There’s something going on that I don’t like.” Bösch squeezed his shoulders once, then let go.</p>
            <p>Schmidt stood by the food table as he tried to process what had just happened. Schmidt turned to talk to Bösch, but he was already gone.</p>
            <p>Had he imagined it? Bösch wasn’t the kind of person to leave a conversation before it had even begun, especially not with a conversation starter as ominous as “Don’t trust anyone here.” If he had imagined it, then why? Was it the stress? There were more than enough things to stress him out tonight, but he had never been so stressed that he heard voices.</p>
            <p>And if he hadn’t imagined it, why would Bösch say that? He must have had some reason to say it. It might have something to do with their last conversation, two months ago in Besançon. The one about Sofia---</p>
            <p>Sofia. She was in Stuttgart right now, wasn’t she? And Bösch wanted him to see her. That’s what all of this was about, making him see Sofia, wasn’t it?</p>
            <p>Schmidt closed his eyes tight, shaking his head aggressively. He had earned this party. He had earned the right to enjoy himself. He wouldn’t let Bösch’s weird mind games take that away from him.</p>
            <p>He wasn’t hungry any more. He left his plate on the food table and made his way to the back corner of the room.</p>
            <p>“---and that’s why I think the Beans need human corpses.” Rob said, smiling smugly at Sauer. “I bet you didn’t even think about that, but I’ve got you covered, Mr. Sauer, sir. You can thank me later.”</p>
            <p>“That is, well... an interesting theory,” Sauer replied, “but… have you fully thought through the implications?”</p>
            <p>“Of course I have,” Rob said. “It’s the only thing I thought of on the trip here. Why do the Beans have corpses inside them? And, of course, the answer was so simple. It has been right in front of us the entire time.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt asked “What’s his theory?”</p>
            <p>Sauer laughed. “Rob here thinks that the Beans are gathering human corpses merely to collect their brains. He says that the more brains they get, the more powerful they will be.”</p>
            <p>“I’m not joking!” Rob said.</p>
            <p>“Hey, I think that was the first time I’ve heard you laugh, Sauer my boy!” A young man between Sauer and Reist said. He was definitely much younger than Sauer, and had no right calling him boy. He motioned to Rob. “What does this strapping young lad have that I don’t?”</p>
            <p>“Was that the real reason why you wanted to talk to Sauer?” Schmidt asked Rob.</p>
            <p>“No!” Rob replied defensively. “Well, not entirely. I still think we could tell him more about what we saw. You never know, we might have forgotten something as important as the Bean sample. Thanks again, Marvin. If it wasn’t for you, our report wouldn’t have been anywhere near as useful.”</p>
            <p>Marvin mumbled something in response.</p>
            <p>“Did you happen to study the beans on your way here?” Reist asked Marvin.</p>
            <p>“A little,” he replied. His eyes were covered by his hair, his head turned away from her.</p>
            <p>“Can I ask you some questions?” Reist asked, her eyes lighting up. “I’m not scheduled to get a look at them for another few days, it would be very helpful to hear more about them from a primary source.”</p>
            <p>Marvin nodded, and began explaining what he learned about the Beans to Reist.</p>
            <p>“You laugh, but it could be possible, Mr. Sauer,” Greg said, taking a bite of a piece of cheese from his plate. “We still do not know for sure what the Beans use human corpses for; they could very well be harvesting us for our brains.”</p>
            <p>The young man next to Sauer replied. “You say it’s possible, but there is also no evidence that the Beans are using brains for anything, which, in itself, is a fairly wild assumption.”</p>
            <p>“Ah, but there’s no evidence to prove that the Beans are <i>not</i> using brains, Mr. Schubert.” Greg replied.</p>
            <p>“Exactly!” Rob said. “What else would they be using human bodies for? It would be way easier to harvest cattle if they needed meat. And they were able to move on their own inside that jar, which means that they don’t need bodies to move. What else do human bodies have that nothing else does? Our <i>brains</i>! It’s so simple!”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, sure Rob,” Schmidt said, turning to Sauer and Schubert. “Have you guys found out how to kill those things yet?”</p>
            <p>Schubert replied, smiling. “Nope! We had practically no information to start with, but now we have very little information to work with, which is a pretty big step up from a few days ago.” He turned to Marvin, who was still answering Reist’s questions. “Great job with that sample, kid.”</p>
            <p>Marvin looked at Schubert. “Please don’t call me kid.”</p>
            <p>“Ok, buddy!”</p>
            <p>Marvin sighed and continued talking to Reist.</p>
            <p>Greg fidgeted as he stood. “So, you’re saying we still don’t know anything about the Beans.”</p>
            <p>“Other than that they have corpses inside of them?” Schubert asked. “Nope!”</p>
            <p>“Now wait, Schubert,” Sauer said. “I think we learned a lot from that report. We learned that there is a way to paralyze the Beans, which would allow us to kill them easier.”</p>
            <p>“What, are you talking about Adaline’s theory?” Schubert asked. “She hasn’t even had time to prove it yet!”</p>
            <p>Greg perked up. “What theory?”</p>
            <p>Schubert motioned to Reist. “Adaline here thinks that the Beans die when it gets too cold.”</p>
            <p>“That’s a pretty good theory. I’m pretty sure everything dies when it gets cold enough, so there is a basis for it.”</p>
            <p>“But it’s <i>too</i> simple! And it completely ignores the fact that the beans in the jar, which were supposedly killed by the cold, were easily able to come back to life. If anything, it’s only a way to slow them down, not kill them!”</p>
            <p>Greg narrowed his eyes. “You shouldn't dismiss it that easily, though. You said it yourself; we still know next to nothing about them. But now that I think about it, Marvin kept the beans in the jar for our entire return trip, which means that they were able to survive without food or water for over a week.”</p>
            <p>“Silly, the Beans don’t have mouths! Of course they don’t need to eat or drink.”</p>
            <p>“You shouldn’t dismiss things so easily, Mr. Schubert!”</p>
            <p>Rob started rubbing his eyes. “God this is so stupid. They don’t need brains, they don’t need food, they don’t need water. What the hell do they need then? What’s their end goal? If they don’t need anything, then why are they attacking us?”</p>
            <p>“Maybe covering people with beans is how they eat,” Sauer said.</p>
            <p>“Or maybe they’re just hunting us for sport!” Schubert said a little too excitedly. Sauer scolded him, and they devolved into argument.</p>
            <p>“I want to hear more about this theory of yours, Ms. Reist,” Greg said.</p>
            <p>“I’d love to explain it, but I really haven’t tested anything yet. I want to confirm my theory with the bean samples before I spread any misinformation,” Reist replied, turning her attention away from Marvin and towards Greg.</p>
            <p>“But how do brains fit into this?” Rob said, a little too loudly.</p>
            <p>“Rob, you should keep your voice down,” Schmidt said.</p>
            <p>“I’ll talk about brains as loud as I damn well please, Barry!” Rob replied. Schmidt began trying desperately to convince Rob to stop raising his voice.</p>
            <p>The three separate conversations began to get louder as each group talked over one another.</p>
            <p>“Hey,” Marvin said, barely above a whisper. The conversations continued to escalate. Other people in the crowd began to look in their direction; their conversations in the corner of the room were much louder than those elsewhere in the building.</p>
            <p>“Hey,” Marvin said again, a little louder this time. The others continued to ignore him. Sauer began to get visibly agitated with Schubert, who smiled stupidly as he explained in detail why the Beans would hunt humans for sport. Rob repeated the word brains at increasing volumes as Schmidt attempted to cover his mouth. Greg continued to try and convince Reist to tell him her theory about the Beans, though she continued to explain to him that it wasn’t ready yet.</p>
            <p>“Hey!” Marvin shouted, his eyes hidden by his hair. Everyone turned to look at him. “Stop it. You’re being unprofessional.”</p>
            <p>Rob shook Schmidt’s hands off his shoulders. “Yeah guys, this is exactly what Kaplan didn’t want us to do.”</p>
            <p>“Shut up, Rob,” Schmidt said, smiling slightly.</p>
            <p>“Aren’t you glad I didn’t say brains, though?”</p>
            <p>Sauer sighed, closing his eyes. “No offense, Schubert, but you’re worse when you’ve had a drink.”</p>
            <p>“Worse than what?”</p>
            <p>“Worse than normal.”</p>
            <p>Reist laughed, turning away from Greg, who stopped talking the moment she looked away. “You’re finally stepping up to him, Thomas, I’m so proud.”</p>
            <p>Schubert smiled. “How long have you felt that way, Thomas my boy?”</p>
            <p>“You make me uncomfortable, Mr. Schubert,” Rob said.</p>
            <p>“Good.”</p>
            <p>There was silence for a moment. The other partygoers had long since returned to their own conversations, and no one of note had heard any of their conversations. Despite this, Schmidt couldn’t help but feel awkward in the newfound silence.</p>
            <p>“I’m gonna go... look around,” Marvin said simply, leaving the group through a door to the garden.</p>
            <p>“So, does anyone have any other theories they would like to discuss?” Greg asked.</p>
            <p>No one replied.</p>
            <p>“I’m... going to go, then, too…” Greg said as he slowly followed Marvin into the garden.</p>
            <p>“I better get going, as well,” Reist said. “It’s getting pretty late.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll walk you back to our room, Adaline,” Schubert said, holding out his hand.</p>
            <p>“No, thanks,” she replied as they walked to the exit, leaving Schmidt, Rob, and Sauer standing in the corner of the room in silence.</p>
            <p>“But seriously,” Rob said, breaking the silence. “My brain theory has some merit, right?”</p>
            <p>“Do you want me to be honest, Rob?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“Please do.”</p>
            <p>“It is a horrible theory.”</p>
            <p>Rob sighed, dramatically slumping his shoulders. “I expect a full apology when I’m proven right.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll do it in writing.”</p>
            <p>Their conversation dulled slightly before Rob began telling Sauer about how he and Schmidt met in Bösch’s company about a year before arriving in Dijon. After Rob finished, Sauer told them about his medical practice in Nuremberg, which Schmidt found impressive. Sauer must have been an excellent doctor if he had a successful practice in the capital of the Empire. Schmidt avoided talking about Sofia and his past with Bösch, which left him with very little of interest to say.</p>
            <p>As the night went on, more and more of the other partygoers left. Schmidt, Sauer, and Rob eventually found a table to sit at to continue their conversation. Though not many people remained, no one was asking them to leave the headquarters, despite how late it was.</p>
            <p>“I’m going to take a walk,” Schmidt said, stretching as he stood up during a significant lull in the conversation. “I’ll be back in a bit.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t get in any trouble, Barry,” Rob said. “Wouldn’t want to get scary old Krüger mad at you.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt smirked as he walked away. As he exited through a door to the garden, he heard Sauer ask “Why do you call him Barry, anyways?”</p>
            <p>The garden was quiet, lit considerably by the full moon. Some half empty wine glasses and plates of unfinished food littered the benches and tables. The plants were beautiful, meticulously kept.</p>
            <p>Schmidt wandered through another door at the end of the garden. It led to a hallway deeper in the headquarters that was lined with lamps. There were dozens of doors on each wall, the hall seemingly going on forever into the darkness each way.</p>
            <p>Schmidt walked to the left. He passed large, impressive paintings of soldiers, leaders, and battles that he had never heard of. The flickering lamplight made it look as though the subjects were moving within their paintings.</p>
            <p>As he approached a corner, he heard a voice.</p>
            <p>“Are you sure, Humbert?” Krüger asked.</p>
            <p>Schmidt poked his head around the corner, making sure not to be seen. The silhouettes of General Krüger and Captain Bösch stood in the middle of the hall a few meters away.</p>
            <p>“No, thank you, Aaron,” Bösch replied. “I have had far too much to drink tonight as it is.”</p>
            <p>“You were never one to turn down a good drink,” Krüger replied. “I doubt you have had wine as good as this in your entire life. It comes from the Emperor’s personal collection, after all.”</p>
            <p>“Again, thank you, but I must decline. There is much to do, and not nearly enough time to do it. I have wasted too much time at this party as it is.”</p>
            <p>“I insist.”</p>
            <p>“If you keep insisting, I’m going to get irritated.”</p>
            <p>“What happened to you? You can loosen up for one night. The Beans haven't advanced in months, they’re not going to start tomorrow. Come and have a drink with me, you deserve it.”</p>
            <p>Bösch pinched the bridge of his nose. “Look, I appreciate this, but I really must decline. Good night.” He turned to leave.</p>
            <p>Krüger grabbed his arm. Bösch stopped, though he didn’t turn to face him. “Humbert…” His voice was hard and his grip was tight. “Humbert, I just need to talk with you.”</p>
            <p>“You can talk with me here.”</p>
            <p>“I can’t.”</p>
            <p>“Why not?”</p>
            <p>“You know why.”</p>
            <p>“Then you know why I don’t want your drink.”</p>
            <p>“Do you really not trust me?”</p>
            <p>Bösch was silent.</p>
            <p>“You don’t trust me, do you?”</p>
            <p>“Don’t flatter yourself. I don’t think I can trust anyone any more.”</p>
            <p>“No. I want to hear you say it. Say it, Humbert. Say it.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t trust you, Aaron.” Bösch shook off Krüger’s hand, keeping his back to Krüger. “No hard feelings, right?”</p>
            <p>Krüger smiled. “No hard feelings. We are at war, after all.”</p>
            <p>Bösch began walking toward Schmidt. Krüger turned and walked in the opposite direction. Schmidt ducked behind the corner. He wouldn’t have enough time to hide; there wasn’t any place <i>to</i> hide. He stood as still as he could in the dim hallway, hoping Bösch wouldn’t notice him.</p>
            <p>Bösch turned the corner. His face was pale. Schmidt held his breath.</p>
            <p>Bösch noticed Schmidt out of the corner of his eye. A look of surprise, then fear, then confusion passed over Bösch’s face as he glanced back down the hallway where Krüger had been. He was gone. Bösch grabbed Schmidt’s shoulders and pushed him against the wall, in a hurried whisper asking “What are you doing here, Barnabas?”</p>
            <p>“Uh, I was---”</p>
            <p>“Keep your voice down!”</p>
            <p>“I was going for a walk before I left,” Schmidt whispered. “What’s wrong?”</p>
            <p>“How much of that did you hear?”</p>
            <p>“What are you talking about, I didn’t---”</p>
            <p>“You’re a horrible liar. Tell me what you heard.”</p>
            <p>“The, uh… something about getting a drink with Krüger! That’s it, I swear!”</p>
            <p>Bösch sighed, releasing his grip on Schmidt’s shoulders, though he remained tense. “God…”</p>
            <p>They stood in silence for a moment.</p>
            <p>Bösch spoke. “Sofia’s in the city. You should speak with her before you leave.”</p>
            <p>“I… I don’t know if---”</p>
            <p>“That wasn’t a God damned request, Barnabas. Do it. You might not get the chance again.”</p>
            <p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Schmidt began to feel himself get angry, and he hated himself for it. He had months to think about his last conversation with Bösch, and despite the fact that he knew he had overreacted, that he wanted to make things right with Bösch and Sofia, he couldn’t stop himself. He balled his fists. “Is that a threat?”</p>
            <p>Bösch pinched the bridge of his nose. “You’ll regret it. Trust me.”</p>
            <p>“That’s not your problem.”</p>
            <p>“You’re right. It’ll be Sofia’s.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt’s anger turned to regret. He turned away from Bösch, his shoulders tense, leaving him standing in the middle of the hallway. He only hoped Bösch didn’t see his tears.</p>
            <p>He walked the halls of the military headquarters for so long that he lost track of time. When he finally returned to the entrance room where he left Rob and Sauer, his face had been dry for a while. He smiled halfheartedly, and joined Rob and Sauer as they made their way towards the exit.</p>
            <p>“Oh, God damn it!” Rob said as they left the headquarters. “I was so busy talking that I forgot to get anything to eat!”</p>
            <p>“Me neither,” Schmidt replied.</p>
            <p>“I didn’t eat anything, either,” Sauer said. “I am starving, though.”</p>
            <p>“Want to get something to eat with us?” Rob asked Sauer.</p>
            <p>“Sure, my treat,” Sauer replied.</p>
            <p>“I’m… actually not that hungry,” Schmidt said. “You guys can go without me.”</p>
            <p>“Are you sure, Barry? You know you’re passing up free food here, right?”</p>
            <p>“I know. I’ll talk to you later.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt walked away, leaving Rob and Sauer standing in the middle of the dark street in front of Stuttgart’s military headquarters. </p>
