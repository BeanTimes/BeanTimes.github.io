            <p>Schmidt heard the hushed voices of his fellow soldiers, the dull thump of supplies being loaded onto carriages, the hurried footsteps of men moving quickly, and thought one thing.</p>
            <p><i>Finally. It’s been long enough.</i></p>
            <p>Schmidt kept his eyes closed as he lay under his blanket, waiting for someone to shake him awake and tell him that it’s time for battle, and to be prepared to lay down his life. No one came. Schmidt slowly uncovered the face from his blanket, the cool early morning air refreshing, but the warmth of his cot relaxing him even moreso.</p>
            <p>For a moment, he considered rolling over and falling back asleep. If the battle his fellow soldiers were preparing for wasn’t important enough for him to be woken up, why even bother getting out of his sleeping quarters?</p>
            <p>Schmidt sighed and slowly rolled out of his cot. As he stood up, he noticed that most of the other dozen or so cots that lined the walls of the sleeping tent were empty. Rob’s cot was vacant, his blanket on the earthen ground which had been packed down after years of use. Only two other cots had people on them, peacefully sleeping away what would most likely be their last day alive. He let them sleep, exiting the tent.</p>
            <p>Outside was much more chaotic than Schmidt thought it would be. The entire encampment was lit by the flickering light of torches, both carried by soldiers and set in improvised sconces. Other soldiers carried crates of supplies to and from the many sets of waiting horse drawn carts, with carts that were already filled heading west through Dijon. Schmidt assumed whatever was causing the commotion was in the western countryside of Dijon, the same direction where, as far as Schmidt knew, no one had come from in his two years patrolling the town.</p>
            <p>That was also the direction the Empire didn’t want anyone to go.</p>
            <p>Without a word to his fellow soldiers, Schmidt began to help move supplies onto carriages. What the crates were filled with, he didn’t know. He assumed they had muskets, bullets, rations, and maybe even some armor and melee weapons, though musket companies didn’t use them often in battle. Armor wouldn’t do much good against a chunk of lead heading at your chest, and melee weapons wouldn’t do much good against an enemy a hundred meters away.</p>
            <p>After a while, Schmidt began to get bored of loading supplies. The other soldiers worked in an eerie silence, their faces unreadable, so he had no idea how to feel about what was happening. He grabbed a rifle and began to make his way west through Dijon. <i>There were already enough people helping load supplies anyways, and the front lines would need soldiers</i>, he thought to himself. What were they going to do, kill him for wanting to sacrifice himself on the front lines of an epic battle? That sounded a bit contradictory to him.</p>
            <p>The main street of Dijon was busier now than it was at the peak business hours of a regular day. Horse drawn carriages took up a majority of the street, one on each side of the street, making walking difficult for Schmidt. Down the side roads and alleys, he noticed that soldiers were waking up civilians, directing the men to join the soldiers and directing the women and children to get to safety in the Empire’s military camp. Some of the men fought back, trying to stay with their families, though it was mostly the women that refused to let their husbands leave them and their children. Eventually, though, the men headed west, and the women and children headed east.</p>
            <p>As he passed the local chapel, the bell above the nave of the church began to ring throughout the town. A little late, he thought, since the bell was supposed to alert the citizens of an emergency in the town. The soldiers had already done that. After a few dozen rings, the bell stopped, then continued after a minute or so. Schmidt continued through the town.</p>
            <p>The western gate was wide open, allowing the carts of supplies to continue their steady flow. Schmidt didn’t think it was a very good idea to leave the gates open when they’re expecting an attack, though. As he exited the main part of town, Schmidt was able to begin to make out a crowd of torches in the countryside to the west. He noticed that armed soldiers became more frequent the farther west he walked. Most of the soldiers were armed with regular Empire equipment; Empire supplied underclothes, a red cloak covering a chainmail breastplate, a musket, and a small knife hooked on the belt. Schmidt felt underdressed, wearing only his worn, beige underclothes and carrying a musket. Hopefully his fellow soldiers would still honor his sacrifice. The rest of the men heading west, who Schmidt assumed were villagers that were instructed to assist in the battle, weren’t wearing much more than he was. Some didn’t even have weapons that he could see. Yet, everyone he saw continued west. One man even sprinted past him, presumably as desperate to die as he was.</p>
            <p>As Schmidt watched the man run into the distance, he began to realize how silent it was, the only sounds being the footsteps of the soldiers as they quietly walked west. Schmidt wasn’t used to waking up very early, but he would have thought that the early morning would be more lively.</p>
            <p>Besides the early morning twilight, the only light came from the stars overhead and the waxing moon. Despite the dark, he noticed a series of carriages moving through the fields to his left, coming from the direction of the Ouche river carrying what seemed to be large logs, probably from the mills that worked on the river’s banks. He had no idea what they would use unchopped logs for, but if they were desperate enough to use lengths of timber, he didn’t think the situation was exactly good. All the better a stage to set a tide turning sacrifice.</p>
            <p>The sun began to peek over the horizon in the east behind Schmidt, the increasingly common clumps of trees casting long shadows over the rolling countryside. The group of torches he saw earlier from the town seemed to converge a few hundred meters from the edge of the tree line that eventually grew into a forest. The space between the trees was easily enough for two carts to fit between, but there was a noticeable difference between the fields surrounding Dijon and the burgeoning forest to the west.</p>
            <p>Finally, he entered the group of torches. Dozens of men, maybe even a few hundred, were moving around the improvised camp with a fearful purpose. Few soldiers spoke besides Captain Bösch, who was speaking in his usual, booming shouts with a small group of people Schmidt didn’t know. He avoided Bösch and made his way towards the improvised defences in front of him. There were no people past the defences, the edge of the forest barely lit by the torchlight and rising sun.</p>
            <p>Besides the occasional shouts from the captain, there was no noise. For the first time since Schmidt had joined the military, he was beginning to feel nervous. Still, he stood at the western defences, holding his rifle, thinking not about his life, but about his death.</p>
            <p>A sudden voice next to him made him jump slightly. “Hey, Barry. Took you long enough. I thought you would’ve been here first, considering the situation.” There was an edge in Rob’s voice. As long as Schmidt had known him, Rob had never sounded how he sounded now. That, more than anything else about the situation, unnerved Schmidt.</p>
            <p>“Don’t call me Barry. And yeah, maybe you should’ve woken me up. I could’ve missed all the fun.” Schmidt tried to keep the edge out of his own voice. Based on Rob’s expression, he was failing.</p>
            <p>“I won’t let you die here, Barnabas.” Rob’s voice was harder than before. Though, that was something that Rob had never done for as long as Schmidt had known. He called him Barnabas. Rob’s jaw was quivering, though he didn’t think it was because of the early morning cold.</p>
            <p>“Well, if I can’t die here, you better not die here either. You’re supposed to tell everyone how legendary my sacrifice was.”</p>
            <p>“We have a deal, then.”</p>
            <p>Silence.</p>
            <p>The sun rose steadily behind them.</p>
            <p>“What are we fighting?” Schmidt asked.</p>
            <p>“I dunno. I don’t think anyone knows. No one here, at least. They’re certainly worried about whatever it is, though.”</p>
            <p>“Do you think we should be worried?”</p>
            <p>“Probably.”</p>
            <p>Another silence.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, a light appeared in the forest ahead of them.</p>
            <p>“Do you see that?” Rob asked.</p>
            <p>“Yeah.” Schmidt replied.</p>
            <p>“I think that’s the scout. Bösch sent out a scout earlier, to see if they could locate the enemy. Whatever the enemy is.”</p>
            <p>Conversation began to break out through the soldiers at the defences. A voice to Schmidt’s right yelled out “Captain Bösch! Captain, the scout is coming back!” For a moment, Schmidt considered sneaking away from the improvised defences to avoid Bösch. He eventually decided against it.</p>
            <p>The scout continued towards the defences. Schmidt could make him out now. He rode a dark brown horse, wore Empire supplied clothes, and there was something on his back.</p>
            <p>Something large, something dark.</p>
            <p>“What… is that?” Rob asked.</p>
            <p>Without thinking, Schmidt readied his musket. Though Schmidt remained silent, the soldiers around him spoke in worried whispers.</p>
            <p>The scout began to shout, hitting the dark mass on his back. The soldiers behind the defences fell into an uneasy silence, watching as the scout began thrashing on his steed, trying desperately to get the dark mass off of his back. The horse, upset by this, began trying to buck the scout off.</p>
            <p>In the chaos, Schmidt noticed that the dark mass was moving.</p>
            <p>The scout dropped the torch, which extinguished itself on the damp morning ground. The quick transition momentarily blinded Schmidt as his eyes adjusted to the much darker early morning twilight. In the darkness, the scout’s shouts turned to panicked screams, and the horse continued to whine with fright.</p>
            <p>The soldiers behind the defences were silent.</p>
            <p>There was a thud, the scout’s screams turning to pained moans. After a moment, the now riderless horse ran past the defences toward Dijon. Then, the scout’s moans slowly began to die.</p>
            <p>Schmidt’s eyes adjusted, allowing him to see a scout’s corpse lying on the ground near where he had dropped his torch. The corpse wasn’t motionless. The clothes seemed to writhe, as though a collection of rats were crawling on the scout’s corpse.</p>
            <p>Then, slowly, the corpse began to get up.</p>
            <p>In fear, Schmidt’s finger slipped, compressing the musket’s trigger, firing a single shot into the darkness. Surprised by the recoil, Schmidt fell onto his back, dropping his musket. Through a gap in the improvised defences, he saw the scout’s corpse.</p>
            <p>It rose unsteadily, standing for a moment at full height.</p>
            <p>It took a single step forward. It moved like a drunkard, the dark mass, seemingly covering the outside of the scout's corpse, still writhing. After a moment, it took another step forward. Shortly after, it took another step. Then another.</p>
            <p>The dark being, the monster, began to take another step, then fell over. Almost immediately the monster got back to its feet, taking another step forward. Though it still walked like a drunkard, it had begun to take each step quicker, each with more purpose.</p>
            <p>Then it stopped.</p>
            <p>The monster’s head slowly tilted towards the sky.</p>
            <p>A wet scream that sounded like a drowning animal came from the monster, then slowly began to come from every direction.</p>
            <p>“What the actual hell.” Rob said, his voice full of fear.</p>
            <p>The screams slowly died out.</p>
            <p>Rob stuttered. “You heard that, right? You saw that too, right, Barry? Tell me I’m going insane, please tell me this isn’t real, Barry... please tell me this isn’t real.” Either he had given up trying to control his shaking arms, or he couldn’t stop himself.</p>
            <p>The monster using the body of the scout staggered behind a nearby tree, it's dark body swallowed by the shadows cast by the steadily rising sun, now peeking slightly over the land in the east.</p>
            <p>“I… I think it’s real.” Schmidt replied, his mouth dry.</p>
            <p>From deep within the forest, dozens more monsters began to exit the shadows, moving toward the group of Empire soldiers.</p>
            <p>Chaos erupted along the improvised defences in the western countryside of Dijon.</p>
