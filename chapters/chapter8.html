                4am October 5th, 1587 - Dijon, Kingdom of France

            <h3>
                My involvement in these events began in the small farming village of Dijon, in the Kingdom of France. Sometimes, I like to think back on my time in Dijon. Back then, everything was much more peaceful.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Schmidt heard the hushed voices of his fellow soldiers, the dull thump of supplies being loaded onto carts, the hurried footsteps of men moving quickly around the camp, and muttered one word to himself. “Finally.”</p>
            <p>He kept his eyes closed as he lay under his blanket, waiting for someone to shake him awake and tell him that it’s time for battle, to be prepared to lay down his life. He waited, but no one came. He slowly moved his head out from under his blanket, the cool early morning air refreshing, but the warmth of his cot much more relaxing.</p>
            <p>For a moment, he considered rolling over and falling back asleep. If no one was going to wake him for the battle, was it even worth getting out of bed?</p>
            <p>Schmidt sighed and slowly rolled out of his cot. As he stood up, he noticed that most of the other dozen or so cots that lined the walls of the sleeping tent were empty. Rob’s cot was vacant, his blanket on the earthen ground which had been packed down after a year of use. Only two other cots had people in them, peacefully sleeping away what would most likely be their last day alive. He let them sleep, exiting the tent.</p>
            <p>Outside was much more chaotic than Schmidt had anticipated. The entire area was lit by the flickering light of torches, both carried by soldiers and set in improvised sconces around the encampment. Other soldiers carried crates of supplies to and from the many sets of waiting horse drawn carts, with carts that were already filled heading west through Dijon. Schmidt assumed whatever was causing the commotion was in the western countryside of Dijon, the same direction where, as far as Schmidt knew, no one had come from in his entire time patrolling the town.</p>
            <p>That was also the direction the Empire didn’t want anyone to go.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Markus Dietrich, Captain Bösch’s second in command, organized the effort, arrogantly commanding the soldiers around him. Schmidt avoided Dietrich more than he avoided Bösch, and he didn’t intend to start talking to him now. Without a word to his fellow soldiers, Schmidt began to help move supplies onto carts. What the crates were filled with, he didn’t know. He assumed they had muskets, bullets, rations, and maybe even some armor and melee weapons, though musket companies didn’t use them often in battle.</p>
            <p>The other soldiers worked in an eerie silence, their faces unreadable. No one spoke about what was happening. After a while, Schmidt began to get bored of loading supplies and tired of Dietrich’s overbearing commands, so he grabbed a musket and began to make his way west, leaving the other soldiers to load the carts.</p>
            <p>The main street of Dijon bustled with movement despite the early hours. Horse drawn carts took up a majority of the street, one on each side, making it difficult for soldiers to walk. Down the side roads, Schmidt noticed soldiers arguing with civilians, who were unable to communicate through the language barrier. The soldiers tried to explain that they were in immediate danger, while the French men fought with the soldiers and the women cried and the children yelled. Despite the amount of time that had passed since the soldiers began evacuating civilians, many remained in the streets.</p>
            <p>As he passed the local chapel, the bell above stopped ringing, and began again a minute or so after. Schmidt passed a group of French women who held bags full of their belongings, leading their children east with the help of an Empire soldier. The women were crying.</p>
            <p>The western gate was open, carts of supplies continuing their steady flow in and out of the walls. Schmidt thought it was a bad idea to leave the gate open if they were expecting an attack as he exited the town walls. Armed soldiers became more frequent the further west he walked, most of them wearing regulation Empire equipment; Empire supplied underclothes, a red cloak covering a chainmail breastplate, and a musket. Schmidt felt underdressed, wearing only his worn beige underclothes and carrying a musket. Despite the preparation of the soldiers, the French men forced to assist the Empire were no more prepared than Schmidt was.</p>
            <p>He thought about the coming battle as he walked. He would have to wait for the perfect moment, though he didn’t want to wait too long before turning the tide of the battle. If too many soldiers died, there would be no one to speak of his epic sacrifice. He would also have to wait until sunrise, so everyone would be able to watch. Halfway between Dijon and the western camp, a man even sprinted past him, presumably as desperate to die as he was.</p>
            <p>As Schmidt watched the man run into the distance, he began to realize how silent it was, the only sounds being the footsteps of the soldiers as they quietly walked west. Schmidt wasn’t used to waking up very early, but he would have thought that the early morning would be more lively; no birds sang, no squirrels chirped. It was quiet.</p>
            <p>Besides the early morning twilight, the only light came from the stars overhead and the waxing moon. Despite the dark, he noticed horses in the fields to his left dragging logs from the mills along the Ouche river. He had no idea what they would use logs for, but if they were desperate enough to use lengths of uncut timber, he didn’t think the situation was exactly good.</p>
            <p>All the better a stage to set a tide turning sacrifice.</p>
            <p>The sun began to peek over the horizon in the east behind Schmidt, the increasingly common clumps of trees casting long shadows over the rolling countryside. The western camp was a few dozen meters from the edge of a thin forest, each tree easily five meters apart, the forest floor cast in shadow.</p>
            <p>More than two hundred men stood around the improvised camp. Most of them were Empire soldiers, standing in front of thirty meters of improvised defences, their muskets held lazily at their sides. Confused French civilians stood among them, weaponless and defenseless.</p>
            <p>Captain Bösch spoke with his usual, booming shouts in the center of the camp. Besides the occasional shouts from the captain, there was no noise. Schmidt avoided Bösch, making his way towards the improvised defences in front of him. For the first time since Schmidt had joined the military, he was beginning to feel nervous. Still, he stood at the western defences, holding his musket, thinking not about his life, but about his death.</p>
            <p>A sudden voice next to him made him jump. “Hey, Barry. Took you long enough. I thought you would’ve been here first, considering the situation.” There was an edge in Rob’s voice. As long as Schmidt had known him, Rob had never sounded how he sounded now. That, more than anything else about the situation, unnerved Schmidt.</p>
            <p>“Don’t call me Barry.”</p>
            <p>“Alright Barnabas.” </p>
            <p>Schmidt paused for a moment. That was one of the few times Rob had called him Barnabas. “Uh... well, maybe you should’ve woken me up instead of leaving me in the tent. I could’ve missed all the fun helping Dietrich load the carts.” Schmidt tried to keep the edge out of his own voice. Based on Rob’s expression, he was failing.</p>
            <p>“I won’t let you die here.” His voice was harder than before. His jaw was quivering, though Schmidt didn’t think it was because of the early morning cold.</p>
            <p>He smiled nervously. “Well, if I can’t die here, you better not die here either. You’re supposed to tell everyone how legendary my sacrifice was.”</p>
            <p>“We have a deal, then.” Rob held out his hand, and Schmidt shook it.</p>
            <p>Silence.</p>
            <p>The sun rose steadily behind them.</p>
            <p>“Who are we fighting?” Schmidt asked.</p>
            <p>“I dunno. I don’t think anyone knows. No one here, at least. Maybe Captain Bösch? He’s certainly worried about whatever it is, though. There are rumors about some kinda disease, but I wouldn’t listen to them.”</p>
            <p>“Wait, the disease from Paris?”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, but nothing to worry about.”</p>
            <p>“Are you worried?”</p>
            <p>Rob paused before answering. “A little.”</p>
            <p>Another silence.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, a light appeared in the forest ahead of them.</p>
            <p>“Do you see that?” Rob asked.</p>
            <p>“Yeah,” Schmidt replied. Conversation began to break out through the soldiers at the defences.</p>
            <p>“I think that’s the scout. Bösch sent out a scout earlier to see if they could locate the enemy. Whoever the enemy is.”</p>
            <p>A voice a little to Schmidt’s right yelled out “Captain Bösch! Captain, the scout is coming back!” For a moment, Schmidt considered sneaking away from the improvised defences to avoid Bösch. He decided against it, keeping his eyes on the scout in the distance.</p>
            <p>The scout continued towards the defences, moving between the sparse trees of the forest. Schmidt could make him out now. He wore Empire supplied clothes, rode a dark brown horse, and had something on his back.</p>
            <p>Something large. Something dark.</p>
            <p>Something moving.</p>
            <p>“What… is that?” Rob asked.</p>
            <p>Without thinking, Schmidt readied his musket. Though the soldiers around him spoke in worried whispers, none of them readied their weapons.</p>
            <p>The scout began to shout, hitting the dark mass on his back with his torch. The soldiers behind the defences fell into an uneasy silence, watching as the scout began thrashing on his steed, trying desperately to get the dark mass off of his back. The horse began trying to buck the scout off, causing him to drop his torch which was extinguished on the damp morning grass. The quick transition momentarily blinded Schmidt as his eyes adjusted to the much darker early morning twilight. In the darkness, the scout’s shouts turned to screams, the horse continuing to whine with fright.</p>
            <p>The soldiers behind the defences remained silent.</p>
            <p>There was a thud, the scout’s screams turning to moans. After a moment, the now riderless horse ran past the defences toward Dijon. The scout’s moans slowly died somewhere in the thin forest ahead of Schmidt. As his eyes adjusted, he could see that the corpse was moving, writhing, as though something was crawling over the scout’s corpse.</p>
            <p>Slowly, the corpse began to get up.</p>
            <p>In fear, Schmidt’s finger slipped, compressing the musket’s trigger, firing a single shot into the darkness, missing the scout, hitting a tree in the distance. Surprised by the recoil, Schmidt fell onto his back, dropping his musket, watching the scout’s corpse move through a small gap in the improvised defences.</p>
            <p>It rose unsteadily, standing for a moment at full height.</p>
            <p>It took a single step forward, moving like a drunkard, the dark mass covering the outside of the scout's corpse still writhing. After a moment, it took another step forward. Shortly after, it took another step. Then another.</p>
            <p>The dark being, the monster, began to take another step, then fell over. Almost immediately the monster got back to its feet, taking another step forward. Though it still walked like a drunkard, it had begun to take each step quicker, each with more purpose.</p>
            <p>It stopped walking. The dark mass covering the corpse stopped writhing.</p>
            <p>The monster’s head slowly tilted towards the sky.</p>
            <p>A wet scream that sounded like a drowning animal came from the monster, then another, and another, until a chorus of screams echoed over the early morning countryside.</p>
            <p>“What the actual hell,” Rob said, his voice full of fear.</p>
            <p>The screams slowly died out, one by one, returning the countryside to a piercing silence.</p>
            <p>Rob stuttered “You heard that, right? You <i>saw</i> that, right, Barry? Tell me I’m going insane, please... please, tell me this isn’t real, Barry... please, <i>God</i>, tell me this isn’t real...” He had given up on trying to control his shaking arms.</p>
            <p>The monster using the corpse of the scout staggered behind a nearby tree, it's dark body swallowed by the shadows cast by the steadily rising sun.</p>
            <p>“I… I think it’s real,” Schmidt replied, his mouth dry.</p>
            <p>From deep within the forest, dozens of monsters began to dart between the shadows, moving steadily towards the group of Empire soldiers.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, chaos erupted in the western countryside of Dijon.</p>
