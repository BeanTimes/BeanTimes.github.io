                Though we do not know the exact origin of the abnormal Beans, it is theorized that they are a collective of drone Beans that, through some unknown process, are able to draw more power than the regular drone Beans. If the Beans’ goal was to merely wipe out humanity, it would make sense for them to only send their strongest soldiers, the abnormal Beans. However, that is not the case, implying that there is some limit to the amount of abnormal Beans that can exist. Or perhaps they are merely waiting for the right time to use them.

            <p>Krause woke up to Annemarie crying and was momentarily confused, forgetting where she was before remembering she was in her new house. She and Henry had just finished moving into the small, one room house provided to them in the middle of Stuttgart, and she was still not used to waking up there. Though the house was not much smaller than their cottage in Horb, the bustling, now overcrowded streets outside their window were an unusual sight to Krause, who had never been more than twenty kilometers outside of Horb.</p>
            <p>She groaned as she sat up, her necklace falling over her chest. She must have forgotten to take it off again. She pushed herself out of bed, walking over to Annemarie’s crib to calm her down. </p>
            <p>“Good morning,” Henry greeted her from the kitchen area in the corner of their house. “Did Annemarie wake you?”</p>
            <p>Krause yawned, picking Annemarie up. “Yeah. She really has been a little devil recently, hasn’t she?”</p>
            <p>“I’m amazed you can sleep in this late anyways, I can’t get used to the noise.”</p>
            <p>“I must still be tired from the move. Such a big change so quick really wiped me out,” Krause replied, setting Annemarie in her chair to be fed.</p>
            <p>She joined Henry in the kitchen to get food for Annemarie. She began peeling an apple as Henry finished preparing boiled eggs. “So much has changed. It feels like we’ve been here for years, but it’s barely been two months,” Henry replied. Krause noticed deep bags under his eyes in the firelight.</p>
            <p>“I still think…” Krause began, then paused. She was about to start talking about how they should have stayed in Horb, that they would have been safe, but something stopped her. She played with her necklace nervously. “We should be looking at the bright side of the situation. You always talked about living in the city, didn’t you?”</p>
            <p>Henry smiled softly to himself. “This wasn’t exactly what I had in mind.”</p>
            <p>“The worst of it is over. We’ve settled in. You’re getting paid much more than you were in Horb.”</p>
            <p>“The Beans have stopped advancing... at least for now.”</p>
            <p>Krause smiled. “Yes. That too.”</p>
            <p>“I guess you’re right,” Henry said as they sat down to eat breakfast. He fed peeled apple slices to Annemarie absentmindedly. “This could be much worse.”</p>
            <p>They ate breakfast together, enjoying each other’s company. Henry had the day off work, so he was able to watch Annemarie and give Krause the chance to go to the marketplace.</p>
            <p>As she stepped out of her house, she saw her neighbor Maria watering a potted plant in front of her house. She waved excitedly at Krause, who returned it with a dismissive wave. Fortunately, this time Maria accepted that Krause didn’t want to talk right now and returned to her gardening.</p>
            <p>Krause walked through the unfamiliar streets as she made her way towards the main street of Stuttgart. She entered the bustling street, still not used to the amount of people living in the city. Krause thought there were more people in the main street of Stuttgart now than lived in Horb before the Bean attacks.</p>
            <p>She turned onto a side street and recited the directions to St. Nicholas’ Church on her head. She fiddled with her necklace as she rounded a corner, turning down an alley which exited at the edge of Stuttgart’s marketplace. Her eyes caught a stack of fresh cabbages, and her mind wandered to Loretta. Had Loretta gotten out of Horb safely? She had said that she was evacuating to Stuttgart as well. Was she in the city now? She gripped her necklace a little tighter than before.</p>
            <p>Eventually, she reached St. Nicholas’ Church and walked inside. Gloria was already sitting at the front with Pastor Schulz, the pastor for St. Nicholas’ Church of the Beanmeister and the assistant to Pastor Meier, the pastor for the church’s Christian congregation. Gloria shot her an annoyed look as Pastor Schulz greeted her from the altar. She joined them at the front, walking past the pews where two dozen other members were sitting. When she arrived at the front, she smiled at Gloria, whose eyes hadn’t left her since she entered. She started at Krause until the door swung open and Sam and Leon Schubert, a new member of the Church, walked in talking loudly about the Beans.</p>
            <p>“Ah, lovely. Now that everyone is here, we can begin.” Pastor Schultz’ voice pulled Krause and Gloria’s eyes to the altar. Sam and Leon sat down in the front row of the pews as Pastor Schultz opened a bible to begin his sermon.</p>
            <p>“As said in Thessalonians, 4:17: ‘Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord,’” he began, his voice filling the room. “The Beanmeister has been sent by the Lord to deliver us, the believers, from our mortal flesh and blood. Just as Christ delivered himself unto us, allowing himself to be placed upon the cross as penance for our sins, so too shall we allow ourselves to repent, here, today, so that we may find peace, and be accepted into Heaven.</p>
            <p>“But, before I begin today’s sermon, there are a few things I need to address. First things first, some of the unbelievers are a little… upset with us. You guys really need to stop murdering innocent civilians in the streets, it’s giving us a bad name...” Schulz paused, smiling as he glanced around the congregation. The churchgoers exchanged confused looks. “Joking, I’m joking guys! There haven’t been any killings yet, and let's keep it that way!” He cleared his throat. “Anyways, the real announcements this time… There have been some reports of members of our congregation wearing their ceremonial garb outside, which I shouldn’t have to say is not something you should be doing. A few members have mentioned they are being harassed in town when wearing their robes, and to them I say: even though we want to spread our message to the rest of the town, we don’t want to risk anything because of that. Take off your robes when you’re in public, guys, come on! And finally, remember that we must all be prepared to give up our mortal flesh when the Beanmeister comes to deliver us to Heaven for our commitment to His cause, which we can’t do if our bodies have been damaged or otherwise tainted, because of robe related injuries or otherwise.”</p>
            <p>Krause continued to listen to the sermon, glancing at different members of the congregation as Schulz spoke. Sam and Leon were listening intently to the sermon, while a pair of new members near the back glanced nervously around the church. Many of the regulars within the congregation spoke words of affirmation during the service, while others prayed.</p>
            <p>After Pastor Schultz finished the sermon, he dismissed the congregation to go about their days. A few people took their robes off and left the church, though others stayed and talked with other members.</p>
            <p>Sam and Leon walked to the front of the church after the sermon. “Hey, Julia, my friend Leon here had a few questions about the Beans. Would it be ok if he asked you?”</p>
            <p>Leon held out his hand. “Hey, Leon Schubert. I’ll just get to the point; I was wondering what the Beans are, exactly? I’m interested in joining the Church of the Beanmeister, but I don’t want to do that without knowing what I’m worshiping.”</p>
            <p>Krause stared at him. “Are you new here? I haven’t seen you before.”</p>
            <p>Sam replied “Yeah, we met last week and he said he was interested---”</p>
            <p>Krause interrupted him. “I want to hear from Leon.”</p>
            <p>Leon smiled. “Yeah, this is my first service. Honestly… I see how bad of a situation the Empire is in, and I’d prefer not to burn in Hell for eternity, so I want to join the Church and help spread the Beanmeister’s word. Though, I’m not very comfortable believing in a religion I know nothing about.”</p>
            <p>Krause thought for a moment. “Come to a few more meetings. Once I think you’re worthy, I will tell you everything I know.”</p>
            <p>“Ah, that’s a shame. Thank you anyways, Julia.” Leon turned towards Gloria. “Hey, my name’s Leon Schubert, what’s your name?”</p>
            <p>“Gloria Albrecht.”</p>
            <p>“Gloria, nice to meet you. I was wondering if you could tell me what the Beans are?”</p>
            <p>Krause spoke up. “Albrecht, I don’t think we can trust him yet.”</p>
            <p>“What do you think he is going to do, Krause? Tell the city guard?”</p>
            <p>Krause glared at Gloria. “He could. He knows everything. I think it would be safer just to let Pastor Schulz deal with him.”</p>
            <p>“This is not important enough to bother Pastor Schulz over. Though, if he wants to know more about the Beans, he can continue coming to services. He will see their beauty soon enough.”</p>
            <p>“I still don’t think it’s wise to---”</p>
            <p>Krause was cut off by the doors of the church opening. Pastor Meier entered, smiling as he walked to the front of the church. “Oh, hello everyone. I didn’t expect to see so many people here this early. Though I am glad to see more committed congregation members.”</p>
            <p>“Ah, these are just volunteers, helping me clean up the church before the service,” Pastor Schultz said quickly.</p>
            <p>Pastor Meier nodded, still smiling. “It’s nice to see young people so involved in their community, especially during times of crisis.” He smiled at everyone individually as he walked up to the altar, preparing for his sermon later that night. “I hope to see you all here again for the sermon this evening. We are going to be talking about one of my favorite lessons in the Bible. Leviticus 19:18.”</p>
            <p>Krause awkwardly smiled back at Meier. As she turned to exit the church, she glared one last time at Gloria. She was silent as she walked back onto the main street of Stuttgart.</p>
