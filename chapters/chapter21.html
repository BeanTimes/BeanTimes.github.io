                Though we do not know the exact origin of the abnormal Beans, it is theorized that they are a collective of drone Beans that, through some unknown process, are able to draw more power than the regular drone Beans. If the Beans’ goal was to merely wipe out humanity, it would make sense for them to only send their strongest soldiers, the abnormal Beans. However, that is not the case, implying that there is some limit to the amount of abnormal Beans that can exist. Or perhaps they are merely waiting for the right time to use them.

            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Krause awoke to Annemarie crying and was momentarily confused. The ceiling was different, the bed was in the wrong corner of the room, Annemarie’s crying came from an unfamiliar place. Then, the memories returned to her still half asleep mind.</p>
            <p>This was their new house. She and Henry had just finished moving into the small, one room house provided to them in the middle of Stuttgart, and she still had not gotten used to waking up there. Though the house was not much smaller than their cottage in Horb, the bustling, now overcrowded streets outside their window made it feel like they were living in a closet. Krause had never been more than twenty kilometers outside of Horb, so the life of the city was an unusual sight. She had been much more comfortable surrounded by cabbage.</p>
            <p>She groaned as she sat up, her necklace falling over her chest. She must have forgotten to take it off again. She pushed herself out of bed, walking over to Annemarie’s crib to calm her down.</p>
            <p>“Good morning,” Henry greeted her from the kitchen in the corner of their house. “Did Annemarie wake you?”</p>
            <p>Krause yawned, picking Annemarie up. “Yeah. She really has been a little devil recently, hasn’t she? She must not like it here too much.”</p>
            <p>“I’m amazed you can sleep in this late anyways, I can’t get used to the noise outside.”</p>
            <p>“I must still be tired from the move. Such a big change so quick really wiped me out,” Krause replied, setting Annemarie in her chair to be fed.</p>
            <p>She joined Henry in the kitchen to get food for Annemarie. She began peeling an apple as Henry finished preparing hard boiled eggs. “So much has changed... It feels like we’ve been here for years, but it hasn’t even been two months,” Henry replied. Krause noticed deep bags under his eyes in the early morning light from the window.</p>
            <p>“I still think…” Krause began, then stopped herself. She was about to start talking about how they should have stayed in Horb, that they would have been safe, but something stopped her. She played with her necklace nervously. “We should be looking at the bright side of the situation. You always talked about living in the city, didn’t you?”</p>
            <p>Henry smiled softly to himself. “This wasn’t exactly what I had in mind.”</p>
            <p>“The worst of it is over. We’ve settled in. You’re getting paid much more than you were in Horb.”</p>
            <p>“And the Beans have stopped advancing... at least for now.”</p>
            <p>Krause smiled. “Yes. That too.”</p>
            <p>“I guess you’re right,” Henry said as they sat down to eat breakfast. He fed peeled apple slices to Annemarie absentmindedly. “We could be much worse off.”</p>
            <p>They ate breakfast together, enjoying each other’s company. Henry had the morning off work, so he was able to watch Annemarie and give Krause the chance to go to the marketplace.</p>
            <p>As she stepped out of her house, she saw her neighbor Maria watering potted plants in front of her house. She waved excitedly at Krause, who returned it with a dismissive wave. Fortunately, this time Maria accepted that Krause didn’t want to talk right now and returned to her gardening.</p>
            <p>Krause walked through the unfamiliar streets as she made her way towards the main street of Stuttgart. She entered the bustling street, hesitant to step into the crowd. Krause thought there were more people in the main street of Stuttgart now than lived in Horb before the Bean attacks, and it made her deeply uncomfortable. She played with her necklace to help ease her mind.</p>
            <p>She turned onto a side street and recited the directions to St. Nicholas’ Church on her head. She turned down an alley which exited at the edge of Stuttgart’s marketplace. Her eyes caught a stack of fresh cabbages, and her mind wandered to Loretta. Had Loretta gotten out of Horb safely? She had said that she was evacuating to Stuttgart as well, but she had left so much sooner than Krause had. Was she in the city now? She gripped her necklace a little tighter than before.</p>
            <p>Eventually, she reached St. Nicholas’ Church and walked inside. Gloria was already sitting at the front with Pastor Schulz, the pastor for St. Nicholas’ Church of the Beanmeister and the assistant to Pastor Meier, the pastor for the church’s Christian congregation. Schulz had been using Meier’s church as a cover for their operations, saying that the Church’s congregation were devoted to the Christian Lord, which was not wholly untrue. The Church of the Beanmeister <i>did</i> believe that the Beanmeister was an incarnation of the Christian God, though the Christians had tried desperately to distance themselves from the beliefs of the Church of the Beanmeister.</p>
            <p>Gloria shot her an irritated look as she entered the church, Pastor Schulz greeting her as she approached her seat behind the altar. She walked past the pews, which were filled with more than two dozen other members of the Church. Many had been members of Stuttgart’s congregation, while others were assimilated into Schulz’s congregation after the Beans attacked the Empire, and one or two were unfamiliar to her.</p>
            <p>When she arrived at the front of the church, she smiled at Gloria, whose eyes hadn’t left her since she entered. She started at Krause until the door swung open and Sam and yet another unfamiliar man walked in, talking loudly about the Beans and the Beanmeister.</p>
            <p>“Ah, lovely. Now that everyone is here, we can begin.” Pastor Schultz’ voice pulled Krause and Gloria’s eyes to the altar. Sam and the new man sat down in the front row of the pews as pastor Schultz opened a bible to begin his sermon.</p>
            <p>“As said in Thessalonians, 4:17: ‘Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord,’” he began, his voice filling the room. “The Beanmeister has been sent by the Lord to deliver us, the believers, from our mortal flesh and blood. Just as Christ delivered himself unto us, allowing himself to be placed upon the cross as penance for our sins, so too shall we allow ourselves to repent, here, today, so that we may find peace, and be accepted into Heaven.</p>
            <p>“But, before I begin today’s sermon, there are a few things I need to address. First things first, some of the unbelievers are a little… upset with us. You guys really need to stop murdering innocent civilians in the streets, it’s giving us a bad name...” Schulz paused, half laughing as he glanced around the congregation. The churchgoers exchanged confused looks. “Joking, I’m joking guys! There haven’t been any murders yet, and let's keep it that way!” He cleared his throat. “Anyways, the real announcements this time… There have been some reports of members of our congregation wearing their ceremonial garb outside, which I shouldn’t have to say is not something you should be doing. A few members have mentioned that they are being harassed in town when wearing their robes, and all I can say to them is this: even though we want to spread our message to the rest of the town, we don’t want to risk anything because of that. Take off your robes when you’re in public, guys, come on, it’s not that hard. And finally, remember that we must all be prepared to give up our mortal flesh when the Beanmeister comes to deliver us to Heaven for our commitment to His cause, which we can’t do if our bodies have been damaged or otherwise tainted because of robe related injuries or otherwise.”</p>
            <p>Krause continued to listen to the sermon, glancing at different members of the congregation as Schulz spoke. Sam and his friend were listening intently to the sermon, while a pair of new members near the back glanced nervously around the church. Many of the regulars within the congregation spoke words of affirmation during the service, while others prayed.</p>
            <p>After Pastor Schultz finished the sermon, he dismissed the congregation to go about their days. A few people took their robes off and left the church, though others stayed and talked with other members.</p>
            <p>After the sermon, Sam walked to the front of the church, followed closely by his friend. “Hey, Julia, my friend Leon here had a few questions about the Beans. Would it be ok if he asked you?”</p>
            <p>Leon held out his hand. “Hey, Leon Schubert. I’ll just get to the point; I was wondering what the Beans are, exactly? I’m interested in joining the Church of the Beanmeister, but I don’t want to do that without knowing what I’m worshiping, you know.”</p>
            <p>Krause stared at him, and he slowly put his hand back down. “You’re new here, aren’t you? I’m guessing you don’t really know how things work around here.”</p>
            <p>Sam replied “Yeah, we met last week and he said he was interested---”</p>
            <p>Krause interrupted him. “I want to hear from Leon.”</p>
            <p>Leon smiled. “Yeah, this is my first service. Honestly… I see how bad of a situation the Empire is in, and I’d prefer not to burn in Hell for eternity or anything like that, so I want to join the Church and help spread the Beanmeister’s word. Though, I’m not very comfortable practicing a religion I know nothing about.”</p>
            <p>Krause thought for a moment. “Come to a few more meetings. Once I think you’re worthy, I will tell you everything I know.”</p>
            <p>“Ah, that’s a shame. Thank you anyways, Julia.” Leon replied sadly.</p>
            <p>“I have nothing against you, it’s just that we can’t go telling all of our secrets to new members, or we would---”</p>
            <p>Leon began walking towards Gloria, holding out his hand and smiling. “Hey, my name’s Leon Schubert, what’s your name?”</p>
            <p>“Gloria Albrecht.” Gloria ignored Leon’s hand, which he put down even slower than the first time.</p>
            <p>“Gloria, nice to meet you. I was wondering if you could tell me what the Beans are?”</p>
            <p>Krause spoke up. “Albrecht, I don’t think we can trust him yet.”</p>
            <p>“What do you think he is going to do, Krause? Tell the city guard?”</p>
            <p>Krause glared at Gloria. “He could. He knows too much about us already. I think it would be safer just to let pastor Schulz deal with him.”</p>
            <p>“This is not important enough to bother Pastor Schulz over. Though, if he wants to know more about the Beans, he can continue coming to services. He will see their beauty soon enough. The Beanmeister’s beauty.”</p>
            <p>“I still don’t think it’s wise to let him leave with---”</p>
            <p>Krause was cut off by the doors of the church opening. Pastor Meier entered, smiling as he walked to the front of the church. “Oh, hello everyone. I didn’t expect to see so many people here this early. Though I am glad to see more committed congregation members.”</p>
            <p>The Church members who had not already taken off their cloaks quickly removed them, hiding them from Meier. “Ah, these are just volunteers, helping me clean up the church before the service,” Pastor Schultz said quickly. “You’re here early.”</p>
            <p>Pastor Meier nodded, still smiling. “It’s nice to see young people so involved in their community, especially during times of crisis.” He smiled at everyone individually as he walked up to the altar, preparing for his sermon later that night. “I’m here early so I can prepare for my sermon. I hope to see you all here again for the sermon this evening. We are going to be talking about one of my favorite lessons in the Bible. Leviticus 19:18.” Meier hummed a hymn to himself as he organized papers on the altar.</p>
            <p>Krause smiled back at Meier. As she turned to exit the church, she glared one last time at Gloria. Though they disagreed with each other often, Krause knew that Gloria wouldn’t let Leon interfere with their plans. Even if Leon got around Gloria, he would still have to get past Schulz.</p>
            <p>And even if Leon learned exactly what he wanted about the Beans, it would be too late for him. The Church had already begun to set their plans in motion, and it was far too late to stop them.</p>
            <p>Krause smirked to herself as she walked back onto the main street of Stuttgart.</p>
