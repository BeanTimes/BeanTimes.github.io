                Bean physiology is still a mystery to us. We have only been able to confidently determine three things: drone Beans have human corpses inside of them, individual beans are able to move independently of one another, and Beans are highly susceptible to temperature changes. We have yet to determine the relevance of human corpses inside the Beans, how the individual beans are able to move in unison with such fluidity, or why the Beans are so sensitive to cold and heat. I feel that solving these mysteries will lead to the downfall of the Beans, though I am unfortunately out of time to solve those mysteries myself.

            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Sauer watched as Reist removed the Bean from above the open flame. She placed it on the table. They waited.</p>
            <p>Nothing happened.</p>
            <p>“I can’t believe it…” she mumbled. “Is that really it?”</p>
            <p>The bean was not moving.</p>
            <p>“It can not be that simple,” Sauer replied. “How did we not realize this sooner? We saw what happened in Dijon, and it still took us this long to put everything together...”</p>
            <p>“It’s understandable that we didn’t realize it in Dijon, but I’m a little ashamed that we haven’t figured it out before now. We’ve had months...”</p>
            <p>“It should have been so obvious… Fischer’s group tested extreme heat exposure, did they not? That was what, over a week ago? And they reported that heat does not harm them, correct?”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, they did… I don’t know what that’s about...”</p>
            <p>Reist took the motionless bean off of the table, placing it in an empty jar labeled fire. Four other jars sat on the table, each with a different label and a moving bean inside. A final jar sat with five beans moving inside, labeled with Sauer, Reist, and Schubert’s names.</p>
            <p>Reist stared at the unmoving Bean inside of the jar. “Either way, heat does kill them.” She paused, deep in thought as she looked at the bean. “So, what do we do now?”</p>
            <p>“We should wait.”</p>
            <p>“For how long?”</p>
            <p>“At least until our lab time is up. Another ten minutes should be more than enough time. The others started moving seconds after we finished their respective experiments, though the bean in the vinegar did take over a minute to resume regular activities. However, it may be best for us to wait until our next session to present our results.”</p>
            <p>“Our next session is in two weeks, we can’t wait that long!”</p>
            <p>“We can’t give them false information. Fischer’s group already reported that heat does not kill them, so we would be presenting results that directly contradict previous experiments.”</p>
            <p>“But this is a huge breakthrough! Who cares if Fischer got different results, he was wrong! No one’s found a new way to kill the Beans since Lehmann’s group just cut them in half. Oh, and when Mayer stepped on one and it died. So Fischer’s group was wrong and heat does kill them. Why wait?”</p>
            <p>Sauer sighed, rubbing his eyes. “Do not misunderstand, I agree with you. I just think it would be foolish to rush into presenting evidence that we are not fully confident in. Perhaps it takes them longer to begin moving after being exposed to intense heat.”</p>
            <p>“I’m pretty confident in it. Like you said, the other beans started moving almost immediately. That one still hasn’t. It’s been at least a minute, and it’s still not moving.”</p>
            <p>“Ok… Let’s work on our report while we wait. If it does not move by the time our session concludes, we can hand in our report.”</p>
            <p>“Sounds good to me. And we’re bringing it straight to Bösch, right?”</p>
            <p>“Captain Bösch has been fairly busy recently…” Sauer paused. “However, this is important. Very important. If we bring it to him immediately, this could be on Krüger’s desk in Nuremberg by tomorrow evening. It would drastically change our entire strategy by the end of next week.”</p>
            <p>Reist laughed nervously. “Wow… Just, wow… I didn’t think we’d be the ones to discover something this important… Hey, do you think we’ll be heroes or something?”</p>
            <p>“We should not get ahead of ourselves,” Sauer replied, though he could not help but show his excitement. They had just discovered a new way to kill the Beans. They were one step closer to stopping them from... Whatever they were trying to do. What <i>was</i> their goal? Why were the Beans attacking them in the first place? Sauer shook his head. They did not need to know what the Beans’ goals were, they just needed to know how to stop them. “We should begin our report.”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, the report… the report,” Reist said, making space for her to write. She moved the bean jars into their group’s designated section of the cabinet behind her. “Alright, where should we begin?”</p>
            <p>The door to the lab opened. “So, what did I miss?” Schubert asked as he walked in. “Did you put any in vinegar yet? I wanted to see if they would fizz up.”</p>
            <p>Reist smiled. “Nope, they didn’t fizz, so you owe me dinner. What took you so long?”</p>
            <p>“Those guards took forever to let me out. All three sets of them! I just needed to go to the bathroom, but I guess they’re scared of some kind of Bean outbreak!” Schubert said mockingly as he sat down next to Sauer. “This would be so much easier if we could all experiment with the beans at the same time. If the Beans really did want to break out, they would have already. We’ll be fine, but I guess Bösch doesn’t feel the same way!”</p>
            <p>“Oh, also, we found another way to kill the Beans.” Reist said.</p>
            <p>Schubert gave his full attention to Reist. “How?”</p>
            <p>“Fire,” Sauer said. “Something as small as a candle can kill them.”</p>
            <p>“Really? Fire? Didn’t Fischer’s group already try that, like, a week ago? They said it didn’t work.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know what happened with Fischer’s tests,” Reist said. “Either way, the fire did kill them.”</p>
            <p>Sauer smirked. “What happened to heat being too simple to kill them, Schubert?”</p>
            <p>Schubert turned to Sauer slowly. “I never said heat was too simple, I said cold was too simple. Which, for the record, it was. There have been no reports of beans dying from exposure to the cold, no matter how low the temperature, nor how long the exposure. Once they were heated back up, they returned to their original states.”</p>
            <p>“But fire does kill them,” Sauer replied. “Excessive cold paralyzes them, and excessive heat kills them. If only we knew why…”</p>
            <p>“Uh…” Reist began slowly. “I’ve actually been developing a theory about that. I’m not sure how good it is, but I would like to discuss it with you two, if you wouldn’t mind.”</p>
            <p>“I do mind, actually,” Schubert said. Then he laughed, adding “I’m joking, silly! I wouldn’t mind at all.”</p>
            <p>“Please, go on,” Sauer said.</p>
            <p>“So… Well, I’m not sure where to begin…”</p>
            <p>“Start with why they die in the heat but freeze in the cold!” Schubert said.</p>
            <p>“Good idea, Leon. But before I get into that, I think I should recap what we know about the Beans.” Reist said as Schubert sighed. “First, we know that the beans are able to act independently of each other, meaning that the humanoid Beans that attacked Dijon are not one singular being, but instead a large group of smaller beings acting in unison. This also means that each individual bean is required to maintain certain functions, just as any other creature has to. The part of this specifically that is important to my theory is internal temperature regulation. Second, the beans are able to be killed by being cut in half and by being crushed. This means that the beans are killed when their… bodies, I guess, are destroyed. The third thing isn’t very important for my theory, but it still brings up a lot of questions that we haven’t been able to answer yet. Why are there multiple types of Beans? And do these different types react differently to the methods we have determined are able to kill the crimson Beans? I am working under the assumption that my theory only pertains to the crimson Beans, and not the emerald or ashen Beans.” She paused, then took a deep breath. “I think that’s all the information necessary for my introduction. Do either of you have any questions?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, oh, I have a question, Adaline!” Schubert said, waving his hand impatiently above his head. “When are you going to tell us your theory?”</p>
            <p>“Come on, Schubert. Just listen to what she has to say,” Sauer replied. “It is rude to interrupt her. Especially after you were so dismissive of her theory before.”</p>
            <p>Schubert sighed, throwing his hands out dramatically and pouting. “You’ve been no fun since that party last week, Thomas my boy! What’s gotten into you recently?”</p>
            <p>“Hey, Leon,” Reist said. “Shut up and let me talk.”</p>
            <p>Schubert’s pout deepend as he put his hands down. “Fine. But only for you. I’m still mad at Thomas.”</p>
            <p>“Well, if you two have gotten everything out of your systems…” Reist said, glancing between them. When they didn’t respond, she continued. “My theory is that when the Beans are within their active temperature ranges, they function normally. However, when they enter a temperature below their range, they enter a state of hibernation and go docile. Perhaps this is because they would spend too much energy keeping themselves at a high enough temperature to stay alive, or some other reason altogether. I have absolutely no idea. Anyways, when they enter a temperature above their range, they are unable to do anything to cool themselves off. Humans can sweat, dogs can pant, but the beans are unable to get rid of their excess heat. So, when they get too hot, they can’t do anything and they eventually die. That’s my theory.”</p>
            <p>“So…” Schubert began. “You’re suggesting we fight them with flame swords.”</p>
            <p>Sauer sighed and shook his head.</p>
            <p>“Wait, Thomas, hear him out,” Reist said sarcastically. “Flame swords might just be the weapon we need to kill the Beans.”</p>
            <p>Schubert smiled and continued, unaware that Reist was not taking him seriously. “So, the Beans die when they get cut in half and they die when they get too hot. The easiest way to kill them would be with hot swords, right? All we need to do is heat up some old swords and give them to a bunch of soldiers and have them charge at the Beans, right?”</p>
            <p>“As fun as that would be, I don’t think it would work,” Sauer said. “Assuming that all of the Bean types react to temperature changes similarly, which would be foolish, human soldiers have been proven to be both weaker and slower than the average Bean. A normal human soldier with a hot sword would be no match for an army of Beans.”</p>
            <p>“Thomas,” Reist said slowly. “Are you taking Leon seriously? You should know not to do that by now.”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, you should know to never take me seriously by now.”</p>
            <p>“Well, it is understandable that someone would consider lighting swords on fire to combat the Beans, so I only wanted to present the reasons why it would not work,” Sauer replied quickly. “Now that we are done with that, where were we?”</p>
            <p>“Do you two have any feedback for my theory, or should I just start working on the report?” Reist asked.</p>
            <p>“I feel that your theory is strong,” Sauer replied. “With what little information we have so far, your theory fits. The bean is still immobile, correct?”</p>
            <p>Reist grabbed the jar labeled fire out of the cabinet behind her, returning it to the table. The bean remained motionless inside. “That’s enough evidence for me. I think it would be best to begin our report. The quicker we get it to Bösch, the quicker the army can use it. Be that by making fire swords, or something else entirely.”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, I’m good with whatever,” Schubert said, getting up from his chair. “This will definitely be good for the army, though. By the way, what do you think will happen to the corpses inside the Beans when we light them on fire?”</p>
            <p>Reist ignored his comment, though her eyes went distant as she began to work on her report. Sauer turned to look at Schubert. “What is wrong with you?”</p>
            <p>Schubert smiled in response. “What do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“You know that the people inside the Beans are dead. What do you <i>think</i> will happen to them? Do you think they will come back to life as though they had never died when they are freed from the Beans?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. Maybe!”</p>
            <p>“People died, Schubert. I watched it happen. Reist watched it happen. The least you could do is pretend to care.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, Thomas my boy, I do care,” Schubert said, smiling at Sauer. He paused. “I care so, so much. Though I feel there are other people in this team that don’t care for the facts nearly as much as I do.” His eyes fell to Reist.</p>
            <p>“What do you mean? Reist and I care immensely about this. We care enough to spend all of our time studying the Beans, searching for a way to end this war before it gets too far out of hand and more people die. Neither of us have to be here, yet we choose to.”</p>
            <p>“Keep telling yourself that, Thomas. Or maybe you actually believe that. Either way, you’re ignoring the facts. Both of you, actually. Adaline’s still holding out hope that one day her beloved---”</p>
            <p>Reist stood from her chair, which slid loudly against the stone floor of the lab. “Shut the hell up, Schubert,” she hissed. Sauer had never heard her like that before.</p>
            <p>“Oh, that’s all I had to say. Our lab time’s nearly over anyways. The only reason I was here was to see if the vinegar would do anything. I have some theories of my own, after all. Despite what you may think, I actually want to help some people, too.”</p>
            <p>With that, Schubert walked to the door and knocked. Two armed guards opened it, allowing him to leave. One of them looked inside and said “Five more minutes,” before closing the door again.</p>
            <p>Sauer watched quietly as Reist sat down, returning her attention to her report. After a moment, he said “Are you alright?”</p>
            <p>Reist set down the report, but she did not look at Sauer. “I’m fine.”</p>
            <p>“Are you sure? I am here if you need to talk about it.”</p>
            <p>“I’m fine,” she repeated, her voice harder this time.</p>
            <p>After another moment, Reist began to write on a piece of parchment in front of her. Sauer sat down and reviewed a report created by a previous lab group, who had also been assigned ten beans to experiment on.</p>
            <p>Since they had a limited number of beans, very few of the research groups attempted to find ways to kill them. Many of them decided to observe the few beans they had, placing them in different environments to determine how they would react.</p>
            <p>As of yet, none of the research groups had been able to determine how the beans were able to move, where they got their energy from, or how they were able to reproduce, despite the dozens of concurrent experiments that had been happening for over a week. Despite the beans’ lack of food or water, they had all survived since they had been placed in the jar in the French countryside.</p>
            <p>The report Sauer was reading theorized about why the Beans did not need food, water, or air to survive. He checked it for anything that could contradict Reist’s theory; it was the closest thing they had to a report regarding the internal systems of the Beans, though it was all still speculation. That was all they had so far, besides three inefficient methods of killing them. Theories. Theories, and a dwindling supply of beans to experiment on.</p>
            <p>“Alright, time’s up,” one of the guards said as he opened the door. “You guys know the drill.”</p>
            <p>Reist stood up slowly, gathering her papers and heading out of the door. Sauer followed close behind. Before he left the room, he glanced at the cabinet that held their bean samples.</p>
            <p>Despite the fact that they were still completely ignorant of the true nature of the Beans, they had done it. There was still hope.</p>
            <p>The Beans <i>could</i> be defeated.</p>
