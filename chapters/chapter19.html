                Beans are split into one of two categories: drone Beans, and abnormal Beans. Drone Beans are the common, human sized Beans that make up a majority of their forces. Compared to humans, the drone Beans sacrifice speed and agility for more power and resilience. Abnormal Beans are Beans with exceptionally enhanced abilities, far exceeding that of drone Beans. The two reports of abnormal Beans already have exceedingly large fatality counts.

            <p>Barry,</p>
            <p>This is the last letter I will be sending until you respond. I understand that you are frustrated with Uncle Humbert, and have been for some time; I have also been frustrated with Uncle Humbert’s actions in the past, though I have had the civility to discuss them with him instead of arguing like a child. What I do not understand is why you must take out your frustration on everyone else around you. I have been nothing if not supportive of you since mother and father’s death, and you repay me by returning to the front lines against both mine and Uncle Humbert’s wishes? </p>
            <p>I did not stop you when you denied Uncle Humbert’s assistance, or when you decided to join the military, or when you agreed to defend the city of Dijon for a whole year. I stayed in Rohrdorf, waiting patiently for you to return. I understood when you said that you were too busy to meet my fiancé last June, and when you did not return following the Bean attack on Dijon. However, I do not understand why you decided to return to the front lines. You are only putting yourself in unnecessary danger!</p>
            <p>Uncle Humbert told me about your argument after the attack on Dijon, and he feels that your decision to return to front lines was a direct attack on him. I am starting to agree with him. You are not a child anymore, Barry; why do you insist on acting like one?</p>
            <p>I am not mad, just disappointed. Even if you want to pretend that we are not, we are still family; all of us. Uncle Humbert and I will be waiting for you in Stuttgart when you decide to come to your senses. I expect a full apology.</p>
            <p>No more of your silly “I will make sure my death has meaning” and “We will meet again, even if it is in death” nonsense! You never were much of a poet, anyways. Here, I will give you an example to learn from:</p>
            <p>If you die before you see me again, you are going to regret it!</p>
            <p>With love,</p>
            <p>Sofia.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Schmidt glanced between Lieutenant Kaplan, who stood a few meters in front of the group of thirty soldiers, and Rob, who stood next to him. Kaplan held his arms crossed in front of him, tapping his foot anxiously as he glanced around the crowd, while the soldiers in the crowd avoided eye contact. The sun was bright, though it did little to help against the unusually cold late autumn weather.</p>
            <p>Kaplan repeated himself. “If no one volunteers, I will pick four people myself. I am not going to ask again.”</p>
            <p>Silence.</p>
            <p>“Is this because of the situation with Hannes?” He asked to crowd. “We have been over this many times. Hannes is alive and well, and he will remain in Stuttgart until his arms and legs fully heal. He was not hurt because of the Beans, either, that was only a rumor. In his report, he said his horse got spooked and bucked him off. When we find out who started the Bean rumor, they will be punished appropriately.”</p>
            <p>Behind Schmidt, one of the soldiers whispered something to another. They tried and failed to stifle quiet laughter, which only escalated until one of them laughed loud enough to make Rob jump.</p>
            <p>Who was that?” Kaplan shouted, taking a step towards the crowd. “Was that Rolf again? You do understand that we are at war, yeah? This is no time to be fooling around. Rolf, you are the first soldier in the scouting group. Get up here. Now.”</p>
            <p>“Sorry, can’t.” Rolf said behind Schmidt, smiling like an idiot. He was the same soldier that laughed at Bösch the night of the attack on Dijon. “My leg’s still injured from the last mission, remember? Miss Vogt said I couldn’t go on another mission until at least December.”</p>
            <p>Kaplan glared at Rolf. “Yeah, I remember, though it is practically December now, yeah? I do not think Miss Vogt would have an issue with sending you out again.”</p>
            <p>"You can go ask her if you want, but I wouldn’t waste my breath. She won’t agree.”</p>
            <p>Kaplan sighed. “I do not have time for this. Is anyone going to volunteer, or should I go find Miss Vogt?”</p>
            <p>There was a moment of awkward silence before a soldier sighed dramatically and walked to the front of the crowd. “If no one else is going to volunteer for this sad, little man, I presume I should.” He stood next to Kaplan as he surveyed the soldiers in front of him.</p>
            <p>Kaplan shook his head. “Alright... I guess this is a start. Your name is Greg, yeah? Thank you for volunteering.”</p>
            <p>“Please, call me Gregory.” He said with a smirk, his eyes never leaving the crowd. “I’ll be the leader of this expedition. I know that with myself in charge, we are naught to encounter any semblance of danger. Do not fret yourselves with volunteering henceforth, my valued friends. I encourage any company on this exciting journey. Now, who else shall accompany me!”</p>
            <p>“We still need three more volunteers.” Kaplan added. “I am sure that Greg will be more than enjoyable company, so please, hurry up.” He began to tap his foot again.</p>
            <p>Rob nudged Schmidt. “Wasn’t he the guy who fell asleep in the watchtower? After we got out of Dijon, and Kaplan had to order someone to go wake him up.”</p>
            <p>After a moment, Schmidt laughed softly. “Yeah, I think he was. He didn’t really strike me as the kind of person to volunteer himself, though. He especially didn’t strike me as… that.”</p>
            <p>Another soldier shuffled slowly past Schmidt and Rob, staring at the ground. As he approached Kaplan and Greg, he mumbled “I’m Marvin, I volunteer.”</p>
            <p>“Uh…” Kaplan began. “I... guess we only need two more, now. Thank you for volunteering, Melvin. I appreciate it.”</p>
            <p>“Marvin.” He mumbled.</p>
            <p>“What? You are going to have to speak up.”</p>
            <p>“My name’s Marvin, actually.” He said, a little louder this time.</p>
            <p>“Welcome to the team, Mr. Marvin!” Greg said, holding out his hand. “I’m glad to have you, and I’m sure that the Lieutenant is ecstatic.”</p>
            <p>“That is one way to describe it.” Kaplan muttered, scanning the crowd again.</p>
            <p>Marvin shook Greg’s hand limply, focussed on a dying patch of grass a few meters behind Kaplan.</p>
            <p>“You will surely be the glue that holds our presently undetermined quartet together!” Greg said as he released Marvin’s hand.</p>
            <p>“What an interesting duo.” Rob said.</p>
            <p>“I feel bad for the two other people that have to go on the mission with them.” Schmidt replied. “They couldn’t be more opposite. I bet the conversations would be great, though. Do you think the loud one would let the quiet one talk?”</p>
            <p>“It’ll probably be like when you go on one of your rants. No one can get a word in unless you planned for it to happen.”</p>
            <p>“I wasn’t as bad as that guy, though. And besides, I haven’t gone on a rant in a while.”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, but I still remember them like it was yesterday. I think my favorite quote from one of your rants was ‘It’s not as satisfying to tell a pile of corpses that you told them so.’ Classic Barry.” Rob paused for a moment, then smiled. “Wait, didn’t you tell that doctor in Dijon you told him so? The tall guy with the glasses… Sauer. What was that about? You never told me how you knew him.”</p>
            <p>“I bumped into him in the market a few days before the Beans attacked and told him my theories---”</p>
            <p>“You ranted at a stranger?”</p>
            <p>“We talked a bit before, he bought me lunch and---”</p>
            <p>“He bought you lunch? Barry, were you seeing him?”</p>
            <p>“No, Rob, shut up.”</p>
            <p>“It’s alright, I won’t judge.”</p>
            <p>“You know I don’t <i>have</i> to talk to you, right?”</p>
            <p>“I’m sorry, please continue the story.”</p>
            <p>“Where was I?”</p>
            <p>“The handsome doctor bought you lunch.”</p>
            <p>“That’s pretty much it. He didn’t believe me, so when the Beans attacked I said I told him so. I thought it was funny, actually.”</p>
            <p>“Looking back, it was pretty funny. I was too freaked out by the man eating monsters attacking us to fully appreciate it at the time.”</p>
            <p>“That’s understandable. At least you can appreciate it now that we’re a few kilometers away from them instead of a few meters. I’m kind of glad we don’t have to go back, you know?”</p>
            <p>“Yeah…”</p>
            <p>“I mean, battle was nothing like I expected it would be. Especially not against those… things. I just hope all of this will be over soon, and we can finally put everything behind us…”</p>
            <p>Five minutes had passed since Marvin volunteered, and the crowd of soldiers were beginning to get anxious. Many of them had sat down in the grass, waiting for Kaplan to choose two more people for the scouting mission. Despite his injured leg, Rolf bounced on his heels restlessly. Greg was still scanning the crowd, eyeing each of the soldiers with a smirk, while Marvin sat silently on the ground picking at the dying grass.</p>
            <p>“Oh, to hell with this...” Rob said, grabbing Schmidt’s arm and raising it above their heads, dragging him towards the front of the crowd. “We volunteer, Robert Fiedler and Barry Schmidt!”</p>
            <p>“No, I don’t---”</p>
            <p>“Thank you, so much.” Kaplan said, a sympathetic smile as Rob dragged Schmidt forward. Greg finally took his eyes off of the crowd of soldiers, instead eyeing the two as Rob dragged Schmidt forward. Marvin continued picking at the grass quietly.</p>
            <p>Kaplan continued. “You should know what to do by now, just head west and report what you see. Do not get hurt like the other missions did, we really can not afford any more injuries. If you are not back within seven days, we will assume that you are all dead. Any family will be notified and your possessions will be auctioned. There’s some basic supplies packed with the horses, and Miss Vogt will lend you any medical supplies you need.” Without waiting for a response, he started walking back towards the camp. He shouted to the other soldiers as he walked by. “You are all dismissed, get back to your posts.”</p>
            <p>“Welcome to the team, Mr. Robert, Mr. Barry!” Greg said, holding his hand out.</p>
            <p>Rob took it enthusiastically, replying “Happy to be here, Mr. Greg.”</p>
            <p>“Please, call me Gregory. Gregory Herrman.”</p>
            <p>“Call me Schmidt, and, actually, I didn’t volunteer for---”</p>
            <p>“Oh come on, Barry, this will be fun!” Rob smiled. “You’ve been complaining about how little progress has been made. This is your chance to do something for once! If you find something important, they might even name it after you!”</p>
            <p>“That’s not really what I---”</p>
            <p>“It’s too late to back out now. We’re all committed to this, for better or worse.” Gregory said, watching Kaplan enter his tent in the distance. He turned toward the west, adding “God, do you think I oversold that?”</p>
            <p>“What?” Rob said, his smile wavering slightly.</p>
            <p>“That idiot would have had us stand here all day if no one volunteered. Might as well get it over with quickly, I presume. I think that was the quickest scouting assignment we’ve had since before the incident with Hannes. Besides, there are some things I want to see in the west.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, were you not serious about that.” Marvin said from the ground. He slowly got back to his feet. “Not encountering danger, and being excited to go on the mission with us, I mean.”</p>
            <p>“Of course not!” Greg replied. “Now, Marvin, go get some supplies from Miss Vogt. The three of us will check the horses and gather any further supplies. I think three days will be more than enough to accomplish what we must. Prepare accordingly.”</p>
            <p>“Well now, let’s get started!” Rob said, clapping Schmidt on the back.</p>
            <p>“I still don’t see how you think this will be fun.”</p>
            <p>“Oh lighten up, will you? Rolf was the only person that got hurt from the last three missions, and he barely sprained his ankle. We’re gonna be fine.”</p>
            <p>“Except for the other two missions didn’t come back.” Marvin said as he walked towards the medical tent.</p>
            <p>“We don’t talk about them, it lowers morale!” Rob called at Marvin as the other three walked over to the horses.</p>
            <p>“I like you, Fiedler.” Greg said. “You’ve got spirit. That’s something the other idiots around here are lacking. You could learn a thing or two from him, Schmidt.”</p>
            <p>“Well that’s where you’re wrong, sir.” Rob said.</p>
            <p>“Rob, he’s a soldier too, you don’t have to call him sir.” Schmidt interrupted.</p>
            <p>Rob continued, ignoring Schmidt. “Barry here has the most spirit out of everyone I know. You should have seen him in Dijon! He fought alongside me and Captain Bösch against three crimson Beans, and held his own! Captain Bösch had to yell at him before he retreated, and even then he returned on horseback to save the Captain!” Rob clapped Schmidt on the back again. “I have complete confidence in him, as a friend and a soldier.”</p>
            <p>“Great story.” Greg replied, rummaging through one of the horses saddle bags. “Doesn’t mean he has spirit, however.”</p>
            <p>“Why the hell not? Where else can you prove your spirit than in battle?”</p>
            <p>“My good sir, you are confusing spirit with valor. Valor is courage in the face of battle, whereas spirit is concerned with the characteristics of one’s morals. You have spirit; willing to sacrifice yourself when there is no imminent danger is much more difficult than throwing yourself into a fight and coming back alive. Even that Marvin fellow has spirit, though it… presents itself in other ways.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt asked. “What’s so important about spirit, though?”</p>
            <p>“Who would follow a man without spirit?” Greg said, closing the fourth saddlebag. “Anyways, that’s enough talk of spirit and valor; we can talk all we want on the mission. It seems like we have everything we need. If you want to bring anything else, I recommend that you get it now. We leave in ten minutes.</p>
            <p>Rob held his hands out in front of him. “You’re not gonna defend yourself, Barry? I know you---”</p>
            <p>“I got the supplies from Miss Vogt.” Marvin said.</p>
            <p>Rob jumped slightly, stopping mid sentence. Marvin was holding a small bag of medical supplies towards Rob, which he took and added to one of the horse’s saddlebags. “Anyways, Barry, aren’t you gonna defend yourself?”</p>
            <p>“Defend himself against what?” Marvin asked, patting one of the horses softly on the neck.</p>
            <p>“Mr. Gregory here thinks that Barry has no spirit, can you believe that?”</p>
            <p>“What’s so important about spirit?”</p>
            <p>“That’s what I said.” Schmidt replied. “I just don’t see why I need to defend myself against this guy.”</p>
            <p>Greg smiled. “See, that’s the kind of spirit I’m looking for! Now, seriously, get ready to leave. We’re wasting valuable time here. Remember, we only have a week before they sell our stuff, and I am quite fond of… some of my belongings.”</p>
            <p>“This is going to be a long three days…” Schmidt muttered to himself.</p>
