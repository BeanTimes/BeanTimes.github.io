            <p>Krause wiped the egg off of Annemarie’s face as she thought about how to respond to her husband. She kept her back to him, trying to hide her face as she regained her composure.</p>
            <p>“Please, Jules, just tell me what’s been going on with you and Loretta.” Henry said again, firmer this time. Though she wasn’t looking at his face, his voice told her that he was genuinely worried about her. “I’m not an idiot. I’ve talked to George, and there’s nothing going on between him and Loretta. I’ve noticed you going to the city for hours at a time, alone. George noticed the same thing with Loretta. She’s still the same, but something about you has changed, Jules. Please, just tell me what’s going on so I can help you.”</p>
            <p>There was that word again. Changed. Loretta had said the same thing. Maybe something <i>was</i> wrong with her, maybe something about her <i>had</i> changed… Something that would concern Henry and Loretta, something--- and then she realized.</p>
            <p>She had accepted the Beanmeister.</p>
            <p>“There... has been something going on between me and Loretta, honey.” Krause said, satisfied with Annemarie and turning towards her husband. “Though it’s something you wouldn’t be much help with… woman troubles, you know.”</p>
            <p>Henry stared at her, his eyes filled with concern. “You don’t expect me to believe that, do you?”</p>
            <p>Krause chose her words carefully. “Henry… it’s really something that I shouldn’t talk about with you. Loretta wasn’t comfortable sharing it with George, so I don’t feel comfortable telling you. That’s why we’ve been secretly meeting, to talk about her... problem.”</p>
            <p>She didn’t like lying to Henry, but she had to keep her secret safe. Though, the more she thought about it, was the Beanmeister really someone she should have accepted?</p>
            <p>Church doctrine said that the Beanmeister was sent from heaven to punish the unbelievers. She and the congregation of the Church would be safe, but what about Henry or Annemarie? And even though Loretta had been a massive thorn in her side since they joined the Church nearly a year ago, Krause still cared about her. Would God punish all unbelievers, including Loretta and Henry, or just those that were beyond hope? Would it also be possible that some of the congregation weren’t true believers? In that case, would the false believers hiding within the safety of the Church be punished, or spared for assisting the will of God?</p>
            <p>Was the Beanmeister even God, or merely a messenger? Were the dreams she had been having recently, the uncomfortably vivid dreams about France, from the Beanmeister or from God Himself? How could she be sure?</p>
            <p>Henry sighed, pulling her thoughts away from the Beanmeister. “Alright, I won’t push any further then. Though one thing’s still bothering me. Why did you return home without Loretta?”</p>
            <p>“We walked and talked for a while, getting fairly far from home. I didn’t want to trouble her, so I told her that I would be fine walking home alone and we parted ways near the cabbage fields.”</p>
            <p>“But why were you covered in dirt?”</p>
            <p>“I already told you, I tripped. A little while after I left Loretta, I fell into the cabbages.”</p>
            <p>“Alright…” Henry said, sitting down at the table and resuming his breakfast. “Just… let me know if you have something you need to say. I don’t like seeing you like… this.”</p>
            <p>“I will, honey.” Krause replied, turning back to Annemarie. “I love you.”</p>
            <p>“I love you too, Jules.” He replied.</p>
            <p>Again, she thought about what Loretta had said earlier. <i>Think about Annemarie and Henry. You’re going to get them killed.</i> Would her beliefs put them in danger, or would they protect them from the wrath of God? She put her faith in the Church’s word, but if she was having doubts about those beliefs, could she even call herself a believer in the Church doctrine?</p>
            <p>She had arrived at an impasse.</p>
            <p>She thought about her first service at the Church, sometime last November. A few weeks before her first service, she had met a young preacher in the streets of Horb talking about the Church of the Beanmeister, though she quickly forgot about the odd experience.</p>
            <p>It was only when Loretta asked her to go to a service with her that she remembered. At first, she was hesitant to attend. The preacher in the streets had given her an odd feeling, and the rumors about the Church had quickly spread throughout the village.</p>
            <p>Loretta insisted, however, and Krause reluctantly went. The meeting opened like any other church service she had been to. She had been to enough services that she could quote the pastor Schäfer’s sermon word for word.</p>
            <p>Annemarie smiled up at Krause. “Is that cabbage?” She asked, looking at the rest of the eggs that Krause was mindlessly feeding her.</p>
            <p>“No, honey,” Krause replied, “these are eggs. Can you say eggs?” She repeated the word egg a few times, enunciating the word as much as she could in hopes that Annemarie would repeat after her.</p>
            <p>“Cabbage.” Annemarie replied, smiling and pointing at the eggs. “I like cabbage. Not eggs. Don’t like eggs, like cabbage.”</p>
            <p>Krause smiled, returning to her thoughts as she scooped more eggs into Annemarie’s mouth.</p>
            <p>Pastor Schäfer always opened his services with Thessalonians, 4:17, and a small speech about the Beanmeister. She could almost hear him in her head. “Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord”</p>
            <p>“The Beanmeister has been sent by the Lord to deliver us, the believers, from our mortal flesh and blood. Just as Christ delivered himself unto us, allowing himself to be placed upon the cross as penance for our sins, so too shall we allow ourselves to repent, here, today, so that we may find peace, and be accepted into Heaven.”</p>
            <p>He had such a confident tone that Krause almost believed him. She later learned that the Beanmeister was what the name they gave to the bringer of the disease that was ravaging France. She didn’t know where the name came from, but the description of the Beanmeister Himself had been repeated so many times that she knew it word for word as well.</p>
            <p>He was said to be an incarnation of God the Son, tall and with an unreadable face. He wore nothing but pristine white robes, and carried only a pitch black staff tipped with a pale green orb. He was said to be the bringer of the rapture.</p>
            <p>Slowly, her thoughts drifted to the service a few days ago, where she was finally inducted as a priest into Horb’s branch of the Church. Her duties within the Church would not change, though she would be in more direct communication with pastor Schäfer, and therefore the Beanmeister Himself.</p>
            <p>The past few days had seen changes in her friends and family, too. Loretta was increasingly disrespectful of her and the Church, while Henry had seemingly grown more suspicious of her activities, and both of them seemed to think that she was the one who had changed. She knew for a fact that she was the same as before. Annemarie was proof of that.</p>
            <p>Despite the rapid changes with Loretta and Henry, Annemarie still loved her. Perhaps she had also accepted the Beanmeister.</p>
            <p>Annemarie looked up at Krause and smiled.</p>
            <p>She smiled back.</p>
            <p>And she had fully accepted the Beanmeister into her heart.</p>
