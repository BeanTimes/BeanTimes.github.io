                I do not know why I continue to think about all of this. None of it matters now. Even if I had chosen an appropriate name, that would not change the fact that I am going to die here. I will not live to see the end of the day, and I still can not take my mind off of my previous failures.

            <p>Krause wiped the egg off of Annemarie’s face as she thought about how to respond to her husband. She kept her back to him, trying to hide her face as she regained her composure.</p>
            <p>“Please, Jules, just tell me what’s been going on with you and Loretta,” Henry said again, firmer this time. Though she wasn’t looking at his face, his voice told her that he was genuinely worried. “I’m not an idiot. I’ve talked to George, and there’s nothing going on between him and Loretta. I’ve noticed you going to town for hours at a time, alone. George noticed the same thing with Loretta. She’s still the same, but something about you has changed, Jules, and not in a good way. Please, just tell me what’s going on so I can help you.”</p>
            <p>There was that word again. Changed. Loretta had said the same thing. Maybe something <i>was</i> wrong with her, maybe something about her <i>had</i> changed… Something that would concern Henry and Loretta, something that would upset them.</p>
            <p>And then she realized. It was so simple. She <i>had</i> changed.</p>
            <p>She had accepted the Beanmeister.</p>
            <p>“There... has been something going on between me and Loretta, honey,” Krause said, satisfied with Annemarie and turning towards her husband. She smiled softly. “Though it’s something you wouldn’t be much help with… woman troubles, you know.”</p>
            <p>Henry stared at her, his eyes filled with concern. “You don’t expect me to believe that, do you?”</p>
            <p>Krause chose her words carefully. “Henry… it’s really something that I shouldn’t talk about with you. Loretta wasn’t comfortable sharing it with George, so I don’t feel comfortable telling you. That’s why we’ve been secretly meeting in town, to talk about her... problem.”</p>
            <p>She didn’t like lying to Henry, but she had to keep her secret safe. If Henry were to find out that she was a member of the Church of the Beanmeister… there was no telling what would happen. Pastor Schafer, her friends in the congregation, herself… everyone in Horb’s Church would be in danger.</p>
            <p>But were they more important to her than Henry, Annemarie, and Loretta? Of course she knew they were wrong to doubt the Church, but if her beliefs were going to harm her relationships with her family and friends, was it really worth believing? She felt a dull pain behind her eyes as she smiled at Henry.</p>
            <p>The more she thought about it, was the Beanmeister really someone she should have accepted? Church doctrine said that the Beanmeister was sent from heaven to punish the unbelievers and deliver the believers from their mortal flesh. She and the congregation of the Church would be safe, but what would happen to Henry and Annemarie? And even though Loretta had been a massive thorn in her side since they joined the Church nearly a year ago, Krause still cared about her. Would God punish every unbeliever, including Loretta and Henry, or only those that were beyond hope of conversion? Was Henry beyond hope of conversion? He had expressed his dislike for the Church many times, but would he be able to accept the Beanmeister once he was proven wrong? Was it possible that some of the others in the congregation weren’t true believers? In that case, would the false believers hiding within the safety of the Church be punished, or spared for assisting the will of God despite their heretical beliefs?</p>
            <p>Was the Beanmeister even God, or merely a messenger? The Beanmeister was sent from heaven to deliver the believers, but that didn’t mean he was God. Were the dreams she had last night, the vivid dreams of France and the Beanmeister, from the Beanmeister or from God Himself? How could she be sure that the dreams were given to her by God, and not just regular dreams?</p>
            <p>Henry sighed, pulling her thoughts away from the Beanmeister. “Alright, I won’t push any further then. I just have one more question; why did you return home without Loretta?”</p>
            <p>The dull pain behind her eyes grew into a headache. She began playing with her necklace to calm herself down. “We walked and talked for a while, getting fairly far from home. I didn’t want to trouble her, so I told her that I would be fine walking home alone and we parted ways in the cabbage fields.”</p>
            <p>“Why were you covered in dirt?”</p>
            <p>“I already told you, I tripped. A little while after I left Loretta, I fell into the cabbages.”</p>
            <p>“Alright…” Henry said, sitting down at the table and resuming his breakfast. His face was taut with worry. “Just… let me know if you have something you need to say. I don’t like seeing you like… this.”</p>
            <p>“I will, honey,” Krause replied, turning back to Annemarie. “I love you.”</p>
            <p>“I love you too, Jules,” he replied.</p>
            <p>She thought about what Loretta had said earlier. Loretta had called her a fool. She had said that she had changed, and that the old Jules would have been thinking about Henry and Annemarie. Well, she was thinking about Henry and Annemarie now, so she must not have been as different as Loretta had thought.</p>
            <p>Still, she put her faith in the Church’s word, but if she was having doubts about those beliefs, could she even call herself a believer in the Church doctrine? Would her beliefs put herself and her family in danger, or would they protect them from the wrath of God?</p>
            <p>She had arrived at an impasse.</p>
            <p>She thought about her first service at the Church, sometime last November. A few weeks before her first service, she had met a young preacher in the streets of Horb talking about the Church of the Beanmeister, though she quickly forgot about the odd experience. It was only when Loretta asked her to go to a service with her that she remembered her previous experience with the Church. At first, she was hesitant to attend. The preacher in the streets had given her an odd feeling, and the rumors about the Church had quickly spread throughout the village.</p>
            <p>Loretta insisted, however, and Krause reluctantly went. The meeting opened like any other church service she had been to, and the rest of pastor Schäfer’s sermon preached only of the holiness of the Beanmeister. Krause didn’t understand why the Church had gained a bad reputation around Horb, so she continued to attend services with Loretta. She had been to enough services that she could quote the opening to pastor Schäfer’s sermon word for word.</p>
            <p>Annemarie smiled up at Krause. “Is that cabbage?” She asked, looking at the rest of the eggs that Krause was mindlessly feeding her.</p>
            <p>“No, honey,” Krause replied, “these are eggs. Can you say eggs?” She repeated the word egg a few times, enunciating the word as much as she could in hopes that Annemarie would repeat after her.</p>
            <p>“Cabbage,” Annemarie replied, smiling and pointing at the eggs. “I like cabbage. Not eggs. Don’t like eggs, like cabbage.”</p>
            <p>Krause smiled, returning to her thoughts as she scooped more eggs into Annemarie’s mouth.</p>
            <p>Pastor Schäfer always opened his services with Thessalonians, 4:17, and a small speech about the Beanmeister. She could almost hear him in her head. “Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</p>
            <p>“The Beanmeister has been sent by the Lord to deliver us, the believers, from our mortal flesh and blood. Just as Christ delivered himself unto us, allowing himself to be placed upon the cross as penance for our sins, so too shall we allow ourselves to repent, here, today, so that we may find peace, and be accepted into Heaven.”</p>
            <p>At her first service, he had such a confident tone that Krause almost believed him. She later learned that the Beanmeister was the name they gave to the bringer of the disease that was ravaging France at the time. She didn’t know where the name came from, but the description of the Beanmeister Himself had been repeated so many times that she knew it word for word as well.</p>
            <p>He was said to be an incarnation of God the Son, tall and with an unreadable, stoic face. He wore nothing but pristine white robes, and carried only a pitch black staff tipped with a pale green orb. He was said to be the bringer of the rapture, and Krause believed it.</p>
            <p>Her thoughts drifted to the service yesterday, where she was finally inducted as a priest into Horb’s branch of the Church. Her duties within the Church had not changed, though she would be in more direct communication with pastor Schäfer, and therefore the Beanmeister Himself.</p>
            <p>Loretta was disrespectful to the Church at that meeting. She had questioned the motives of pastor Schäfer and the Beanmeister, and they had argued about it. Henry had been growing suspicious of her activities as well, but Henry and Loretta said that she was the one that had changed.</p>
            <p>But Krause hadn’t changed. She was still the same as she always had been. She continued to hold her necklace, the weight in her hand relieving some of her anxiety.</p>
            <p>Annemarie was proof of that. Annemarie still loved her. Perhaps she had also fully accepted the Beanmeister into her heart.</p>
            <p>Annemarie looked up at Krause and smiled.</p>
            <p>Krause smiled back.</p>
