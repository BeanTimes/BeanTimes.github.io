            <p>Barnabas Schmidt was a man who only said what he absolutely believed, and said with full confidence, “I know exactly what’s going on in Paris.”</p>
            <p>“You keep saying that,” Robert Fiedler replied, “but I’m starting to believe that you don’t actually know anything.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt and Rob were marching west towards the small French farming village of Dijon with the rest of the soldiers in Captain Humbert Bösch’s company, the soldiers’ chainmail breastplates and red cloaks moving slowly across the peaceful, rolling hills of the French countryside. Bösch’s company was instructed to assist French civilians in need after the partial collapse of the Kingdom of France following a plague outbreak in Paris a few months before.</p>
            <p>Schmidt was short and scrawny, his light brown hair obscuring his eyes as they marched. Despite his stature, he held himself as if he was larger than everyone. Fiedler stood a bit taller next to him, his short brown hair accentuating his striking blue eyes.</p>
            <p>Schmidt continued. “I’ve known what was going on since I first heard the news. I kept saying the disease would spread, but did anyone believe me? No, of course not. Did the disease spread? Yes, of course it did. Did I say the Empire should have prepared better? And did anyone listen to me? Yes, I did, and no, no one did. Not even you, Rob.”</p>
            <p>“Barry, you know I listen to you!”</p>
            <p>“Don’t call me Barry.”</p>
            <p>“I always listen to you, even when you go on your weird rants, kinda like what you’re doing now.”</p>
            <p>“You think this is a rant? I can show you a rant.”</p>
            <p>“Please God no.”</p>
            <p>“It’s too late Rob.”</p>
            <p>Bösch’s company had left the western Empire city of Stuttgart a week prior, meaning that they were within a day’s march of Dijon. The oppressive summer heat and long days of constant marching had not kept Schmidt or Rob in the best mood.</p>
            <p>Schmidt began his rant. “The thing about being right in a situation like this is that it’s not as satisfying to tell a pile of corpses that you told them so. I was right about the spread, and I know I’m going to be right about the grander conspiracy---”</p>
            <p>“Please Barry, stop. Oh my God, please just make it stop.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt rolled his eyes. “As I was saying, the Empire knows some secret information about this whole disease thing. That much, at least, is obvious. First of all, why send a whole company of musketmen to a single small farming village? And not just Dijon. While we were stationed in Stuttgart, I heard from other soldiers that their companies were also assigned to keep watch over other small farming villages throughout eastern France. I heard about eight other villages being patrolled. You want to know where they are, Rob?”</p>
            <p>“No, I don’t need to know where they are.”</p>
            <p>“I didn’t ask if you needed to know, I asked if you wanted to know.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t very well want to know either, Barry.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt sighed, but he could see it in Rob’s face, or at least he thought he could. Schmidt could tell that he did want to know. “From north to south, the villages are; Dieppe, Amiens, Reims, Troyes, Dijon, Oyonnax, Voiron, Digne, and Nice. When connected, they form a line up the entire Kingdom, separating the Iberian Peninsula off from the rest of mainland Europe.” He paused for a moment, waiting for Rob to ask why that was important.</p>
            <p>“And why is that important?” Rob asked.</p>
            <p>“I think there’s something going on with the disease in western France that the Empire wants to stop from reaching the rest of their land. Empire soldiers are stationed at a series of French towns to combat a secret enemy that started in Paris. If the soldiers get overwhelmed, they can retreat to the more heavily fortified Empire borders, leaving the French civilians to die. Few Empire soldiers are lost, and no Empire territory is forfeited.”</p>
            <p>Rob did not look convinced, but played along anyways. “Why not inform the soldiers of a potential threat? Why send them to play pretend guard in random French cities instead of telling them about the possible enemy? And why do you even think there is an enemy?”</p>
            <p>“If it’s something the Empire is this scared about, how do you think civilians would feel? Everyone would think that their solution to the problem is right, and that the Empire is handling it incorrectly. There would be civil unrest throughout the Empire. And trust me, there’s always an enemy.”</p>
            <p>“What the hell does that mean? It’s not even an answer, but I really don’t have the energy to fight with you. Why not just tell the soldiers to prepare for an attack?”</p>
            <p>“You know we can’t keep our mouths shut, Rob, come on. If they told us, rumors would spread faster than they already are.”</p>
            <p>“Good point. Is that everything, then?”</p>
            <p>“I just don’t know when… But yeah, that about covers it.”</p>
            <p>They continued to march in silence for a few moments. Schmidt looked along the green foothills that spread out around him, small clumps of trees dotting the landscape randomly. If it wasn’t so hot, Schmidt thought he might have actually liked it here. Rob broke the silence. “I was meaning to ask you about what you were gonna do when you got to Dijon. Myself, I’m looking forward to meeting all the beautiful French women. Imagine it, Barry, imagine---”</p>
            <p>Schmidt sighed again, long enough for Rob to stop mid sentence and wait for him to finish. Once Schmidt finished, Rob continued.</p>
            <p>“---romancing a beautiful French girl while we get paid to play pretend guard in the beautiful French countryside. I can’t wait to get my hands on some of their wine, it’s supposed to be some of the best in Europe!”</p>
            <p>“You can have the women and the wine, I just want a nice battle to die in.”</p>
            <p>“God, I forgot how weird you get about dying. Shuddup about that and gimme a serious answer, Barry.”</p>
            <p>“How many times do I have to tell you not to call me Barry?”</p>
            <p>“Answer the question Barry.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt glared at Rob, who smirked in response. “I’m not sure… I guess some good food is what I’m really looking forward to. These Empire rations are starting to get on my nerves.”</p>
            <p>In front of him, Schmidt noticed the soldiers begin to slow and eventually stop. Captain Humbert Bösch, a small man with a loud voice and silver hair, rode past on this beautiful, pure white stallion Pegasus, screaming at the top of his lungs: “WE’RE STOPPING FOR A QUICK BREAK! EAT YOUR RATIONS QUICKLY, WE’RE NEARLY TO DIJON! WE STILL NEED TO SET UP OUR CAMP WHEN WE GET THERE!” His mustache was waving in the slight breeze atop his steed. He made eye contact with Schmidt, smiled, then winked.</p>
            <p>“God, I hate that guy.” Rob said.</p>
            <p>“Me too, Rob. Me too. Did you see that mustache though? If it was anyone else, I’d be impressed.”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, I feel the same way. Is it new?”</p>
            <p>“I think it is, it looks like he shaved the rest of his beard. I can’t blame him either, it looks great.”</p>
            <p>They sat down and ate, enjoying their well-deserved break and continuing their conversation. After their break, they continued to march west in silence. Eventually, the bell tower of a chapel appeared in the distance, surrounded by a small town, which itself was surrounded by a ten foot tall stone wall. Schmidt, Rob, and the other soldiers began to set up their temporary camp while Captain Bösch entered the town to meet with the local leaders; a messenger had already confirmed with the town that Bösch’s company was arriving.</p>
            <p>After a few hours, a series of tents and tables had been established a few hundred meters from the eastern gate of Dijon. The tents served functions varying from housing the group of nearly two hundred soldiers stationed at Dijon to serving as Captain Bösch’s office. A small stable between the temporary camp and Dijon was used to house the horses and wagons that had brought the soldier’s supplies west. Pegasus got the cleanest box stall to himself.</p>
            <p>The sun had set, and Schmidt’s fellow soldiers had begun to drift to sleep. Rob snored obnoxiously, sleeping on the cot next to Schmidt, who himself couldn’t sleep. Though the tent was dark, a small candle placed on a table in the middle of the cots gave him enough light to begin writing on a piece of parchment he took from his bag. At first, he just wrote some things he was thinking about in short, independent sentences sprawled throughout the parchment at random angles. Soon enough, he got bored of that and began to compose a letter to his sister, living in his home village of Rohrdorf. He would put it with the mail once everyone else got up in the morning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dear Sofia,</p>
            <p>We finally got to Dijon today after nearly a week of marching. The town’s small, maybe even smaller than Rohrdorf if you can believe it. But they have some good defences. This is the deepest I’ve been into French territory, and every town we’ve passed has had some beautiful, high quality walls. Perfect for a battle. Maybe the French are worried about us invading. I wouldn’t blame them; we’re practically doing that now.</p>
            <p>We were assigned to “protect” this little town, in the event of an “attack.” I know that’s a complete lie. We’re here to take over the town and turn it into Empire territory, and to keep an eye on the whole thing happening farther west. I don’t remember if I told you, or if you heard it from someone else, but the thing that “happened in Paris” has actually spread southwest into Spanish territory. The Empire has been trying to keep that a secret, but I have my ways.</p>
            <p>I think I’m going to die soon. My company was sent to the border of a situation that has the Empire visibly agitated, and the Empire doesn’t want to tell us anything. So, when I do end up dying, I’m sorry. It was inevitable. I’ve left everything I own to you, so don’t worry about that. I hope the people of Rohrdorf aren't getting too worried. I won’t let it get that far.</p>
            <p>I’ll make sure my death has meaning.</p>
            <p>Barry.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With his letter finished to his liking, he dated the paper and set it down next to his cot, finally laying down to go to sleep.</p>
