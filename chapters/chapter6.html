                I originally wrote this journal to catalog information about the creatures in hopes of finding a way to defeat them or, at the very least, put up the slightest semblance of a fight as we were mercilessly slaughtered.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Krause didn’t know why the people of Horb avoided the Church of the Beanmeister. She didn’t know why they only whispered of it, and why those whispers talked of psychotic members and religious zealots. She did know two things, however: the Church wasn’t as bad as everyone said, and no one could find out that she was a member.</p>
            <p>Henry was perhaps the most outspoken person in opposition of the Church. When they were alone together, he would call the congregation insane, saying that the Church was nothing more than a cult making a mockery of Christian values. He believed that the Church was merely using the public’s fear of the disease spreading in France to gather followers, but Krause knew that wasn’t true. The disease really was sent by God, and it really was going to punish unbelievers.</p>
            <p>The only thing about the Church that Krause wasn’t sure about was the name. Beanmeister was a unique name, to say the least. She assumed the name came from the small growths that formed on the infected, said to look similar to some species of beans, though she had no evidence to reaffirm her theory.</p>
            <p>Krause had left her home earlier that morning, leaving Annemarie with Henry, saying that she was going to the market to buy produce. Other times, she used different excuses, like meeting with Loretta or going to the Christian church in town, though the shopping excuse was the one she used most. As far as she knew, Henry was completely in the dark about her activities at the Church.</p>
            <p>She arrived at the edge of town and waited impatiently for Loretta to show at their predetermined meeting place. After a few minutes, she spotted Loretta hurrying towards her. She frowned, it was as if Loretta didn't care about punctuality. When she caught up, they began walking to the church.</p>
            <p>As they walked, Krause said “Loretta, if you don't care about being punctual, tell me so I can go myself. As you know, I am very important to the Church. They expect me to be there early.”</p>
            <p>“I'm sorry, it was hard for me to get out of the house, George is beginning to get suspicious of our outings.”</p>
            <p>“We have excuses for this. Say that we are just visiting each other in town, that we’re looking at produce, that we’re planning dinner, you can say anything! It’s not that hard.”</p>
            <p>Loretta looked at her like she was going to say something in reply, but they arrived at the church and Krause pushed through the doors, rushing to the front to take her seat. Loretta trailed behind her, silent as she took her seat and waited for the sermon to begin. Though they were a bit later than they normally would be, their seats were open. Nobody sat there out of respect to Krause’s dedication to the church.</p>
            <p>Krause sat impatiently in her seat, waiting to be called up to the altar. At the last meeting, the pastor of Horb’s Church told her that she was to be officially inducted into the clergy as a priest. She was so excited she almost fainted on the spot. <i>Finally, I’m making something of myself.</i> Krause thought to herself.</p>
            <p>The pastor walked up to the altar, hands folded on top of a Bible, silently waiting for the congregation to quiet. Once they did, he began “Thessalonians, 4:17: ‘Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.’”</p>
            <p>A few in the congregation said words of affirmation, and again the pastor waited for quiet. “The Beanmeister has been sent by the Lord to deliver us, the believers, from our mortal flesh and blood. Just as Christ delivered himself unto us, allowing himself to be placed upon the cross as penance for our sins, so too shall we allow ourselves to repent, here, today, so that we may find peace, and be accepted into Heaven.”</p>
            <p>The pastor continued to talk, about faith, about the Beanmeister, and about the congregation and their duties. After what felt like an eternity, the pastor finally said, “And now, for our last matter of today, I would like to call Julia Krause up to the altar.”</p>
            <p>Krause stood up and walked proudly to the altar, standing next to the pastor. She held a confident smirk as the pastor praised her for her dedication towards the Church in front of the congregation. When he was done, he walked over to a table next to the wall and picked up a small box. The top of the box had the Church’s insignia engraved in the wood.</p>
            <p>The pastor walked back to the altar, holding the closed box. He held it up, facing the congregation, proclaiming “This is a gift from God Himself! Julia has proven herself worthy to God! He left me this gift and told me to have her eat it!”</p>
            <p>Krause hesitated. <i>What does he mean?</i> She kept a proud smile on her face, glancing at Loretta in the pews, who looked as confused as Krause felt. The priest then opened the box, revealing a small chunk of bread.</p>
            <p>“This is the flesh of Christ!” He boomed, holding the box towards Krause. She slowly picked it up and ate it.</p>
            <p>As she swallowed it, she swore she felt a texture that wasn’t bread. She almost gagged, but tried to cover it in front of everybody. After her throat felt clear, she turned and thanked the pastor for the honor. She returned to the pews without saying a word while the pastor finished the service.</p>
            <p>As they left the service, Loretta said, “Are you alright? It seemed like you were about to be sick. What even was that thing they gave you?”</p>
            <p>“I’m---”</p>
            <p>Before Krause could finish her sentence, a sharp pain shot through her head, causing her to fall to her knees in the street. She faintly heard Loretta asking if she was alright while pain radiated through her head. It felt like something was moving behind her eyes.</p>
            <p>Briefly, Krause wondered if she was dying when the pain stopped. Krause sat up and blinked, the world coming back into focus. She brushed off Loretta’s hands and stood up. Loretta stood as well, a concerned look on her face.</p>
            <p>“Jules, what is going on? Are you alright?”</p>
            <p>Krause’s voice was bitter. “Of course I am, you moron, I’m fine. That’s not the point, thought. Do you think I haven’t noticed your attitude towards the church lately? Asking what I ate? You should know.”</p>
            <p>Loretta flinched at the force of her reply.</p>
            <p>“Are you sure you’re alright? You looked like you were in a lot of pain…”</p>
            <p>“Did I not <i>just</i> tell you I’m fine? This is the best day of my life! I feel like I have finally reached potential.”</p>
            <p>“Oh… alright. Do you want me to walk you home, then? We should probably get you to a doctor, though, just in case you’re not alright...”</p>
            <p>Krause paused as a strange feeling came over her. Dread. Krause grabbed Loretta by the shirt and pulled her close.</p>
            <p>“If you so much as hint at any of the events from today to <i>anyone</i> I <i>will kill you</i>.” Krause hissed.</p>
            <p>She felt another sharp twinge of pain from her head, this time only bad enough to make her wince. She let go of Loretta and stepped back. Loretta watched, still frozen in shock.</p>
            <p>“I’m going home. I have to prepare for my duties as a priest for tomorrow's service. Be on time, or don’t come at all.”</p>
            <p>With that, Krause turned on her heel and strutted away.</p>
