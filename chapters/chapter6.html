                October 4th, 1587 - Horb, Holy Roman Empire

            <h3>
                From what I understand, the first mention of the Beans was from Paris in 1585. Though I do not know the exact date of the first Bean sighting, the rumors had spread as far as Nuremberg by July. By then, communication between France and Spain had already ceased, and nothing more was heard for the next year.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Krause didn’t know why the people of Horb avoided the Church of the Beanmeister. She didn’t know why they only whispered of it, and why those whispers talked of psychotic members and religious zealots. She did know two things, however: the Church wasn’t as bad as everyone said, and no one could find out that she was a member.</p>
            <p>Henry was very outspoken against the Church. When they were alone together he would call the congregation insane, saying that the Church was nothing more than a cult making a mockery of Christian values. He believed that the Church was merely using the public’s fear of the disease spreading in France to gather followers, but Krause knew that wasn’t true. The disease really was sent by God, and He really was going to punish unbelievers.</p>
            <p>When the unbelievers talked about the Church, they never mentioned the Beanmeister. Krause was sure that if more people knew about Him and the values He preached, they would be more open to joining. Something that still bothered Krause about the Church almost a year after joining was the name Beanmeister. It was a unique name, to say the least. She assumed the name came from the small growths that formed on the infected, said to look similar to some species of beans, though she had no evidence to back up her theory. Either way, she was happy with the Church and still loved the Beanmeister.</p>
            <p>Krause had left her home earlier that morning, leaving Annemarie with Henry and telling him that she was going to the market to buy produce. She changed her excuses often, making sure that Henry had no idea what she was actually doing. He could never find out.</p>
            <p>She arrived at the edge of town and waited impatiently for Loretta to show at their predetermined meeting place. She played nervously with the necklace Henry had given her. Even though she had done this many times before, she was still scared of her secret being found out. All it took was one wrong move for her life to be ruined.</p>
            <p>After a few minutes, she spotted Loretta hurrying towards her, waving happily. Krause frowned. Loretta had been showing up later recently, and it only put them in more danger of someone finding out what they were doing. When Loretta caught up, they began walking to the church together.</p>
            <p>As they walked, Krause said “Loretta, if you don't care about being punctual, tell me so I can go earlier by myself. You know I am important to Pastor Schäfer and he expects me to be there early. And I’m also scared that we’re going to be seen one of these days…”</p>
            <p>Loretta looked exhausted. “I'm sorry, it was hard for me to get out of the house, George is beginning to get suspicious of my outings, and I’m not sure what to say when he asks so many questions.”</p>
            <p>“We’ve talked about this. If he asks you where you’re going, just say that you’re visiting me in town, or going shopping for dinner. You can say anything, it’s really not that hard…”</p>
            <p>Loretta looked at her as though she was going to say something in reply, but she stopped herself.</p>
            <p>Krause sighed. “I’m sorry, Loretta… I’m just trying to do what’s best for us and our families and the Church… It’s really been scaring me lately. I’ve had nightmares that Henry found out what we were doing, and…” she trailed off as they arrived at the Oratory of Saint Maria.</p>
            <p>Krause pushed through the doors, walking to the front to take her seat and smiling at the others in the church. She made eye contact with Gloria Albrecht, who joined the congregation shortly after Krause, who narrowed her eyes in return. Loretta trailed behind her, silent as she took her seat and closed her eyes, waiting for the sermon to begin. Though they were a bit later than they normally would be, their regular seats were open. Nobody sat there out of respect to Krause’s dedication to the church.</p>
            <p>She sat excitedly in her seat, waiting to be called up to the altar. At the last meeting, Pastor Schäfer told her that she was to be officially inducted into the clergy as a priest. She was nervous, however. In their entire time at the Church, they hadn’t seen a single member be inducted into the clergy, so she didn’t know what to expect. She played anxiously with her necklace and watched as Schäfer entered the church.</p>
            <p>He walked up to the altar solemnly, hands folded on top of a Bible, waiting for the congregation to quiet. Once they did, he opened the Bible and began to read. “Thessalonians, 4:17: ‘Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.’”</p>
            <p>A few in the congregation said words of affirmation, and again the pastor waited for quiet. “The Beanmeister has been sent by the Lord to deliver us, the believers, from our mortal flesh and blood. Just as Christ delivered himself unto us, allowing himself to be placed upon the cross as penance for our sins, so too shall we allow ourselves to repent, here, today, so that we may find peace, and be accepted into Heaven.”</p>
            <p>Schäfer continued to talk about faith, the Beanmeister, and the congregation and their duties. After what felt like an eternity, he finally said “And now, for our last matter of today, I would like to call Julia Krause up to the altar.”</p>
            <p>Krause stood up and walked proudly to the altar, standing next to the pastor. She smiled nervously as Schäfer praised her for her dedication towards the Church in front of the congregation. Loretta beamed at her and gave her a small thumbs up. Near the back of the church, Gloria got up and silently left the building. Krause’s smile faltered slightly as Schäfer walked over to a table next to the wall and picked up a small box. The top of the box had the Church’s insignia, a cross with a Bean in the middle, engraved in the wood.</p>
            <p>Pastor Schäfer walked back to the altar, holding the closed box. He held it up, facing the congregation, proclaiming “This is a gift from God Himself! Julia has proven herself worthy to God! He left me this gift, and has commanded her to eat it!”</p>
            <p>Krause hesitated, her smile faltering again. She glanced at Loretta in the pews, who looked as confused as Krause felt. Schäfer then opened the box, revealing a small chunk of bread sitting in the center.</p>
            <p>“This is the flesh of Christ!” he boomed, holding the box towards Krause. She slowly picked it up and ate it.</p>
            <p>As she swallowed, she felt a strange texture that wasn’t bread. She almost gagged, but forced herself to hide it. After her throat felt clear, she turned and thanked Schäfer for the honor. She returned to the pews without saying a word while he finished the service.</p>
            <p>As they left the church after the service, Loretta said “Are you alright? It seemed like you were about to be sick up there. What did he even give you?”</p>
            <p>“I’m---”</p>
            <p>Before Krause could finish her sentence, a sharp pain shot through her head, causing her to fall to her knees in the street. She faintly heard Loretta asking if she was alright again as pain radiated through her head. It felt as though her eyes were going to pop out of their sockets.</p>
            <p>Briefly, Krause wondered if she was dying. Then, as suddenly as it began, the pain stopped. Krause sat up and blinked, the world coming back into focus. She brushed off Loretta’s hands and stood up. Loretta stood as well, a concerned look on her face.</p>
            <p>“Jules, what is going on? Are you alright?”</p>
            <p>Krause’s voice was bitter. “Of course I am, you moron. By the way, do you think I haven’t noticed your attitude towards the church lately? Showing up late, zoning out during the sermons, asking what I ate? Show some respect.”</p>
            <p>Loretta flinched at the force of her reply.</p>
            <p>“Are you sure you’re alright? You looked like you were in a lot of pain, and…”</p>
            <p>“Did I not <i>just</i> tell you I’m fine? This is the best day of my life! I feel like I have finally reached my potential.”</p>
            <p>“Oh… alright. Do you want me to walk you home, then? I think… we should probably get you to a doctor, though, just in case you’re not alright...”</p>
            <p>Krause paused as an unfamiliar feeling came over her. Krause grabbed Loretta by the shirt and pulled her close. Her voice was low. “If you so much as hint at anything that happened today to <i>anyone</i> I <i>will</i> kill you.”</p>
            <p>She felt another sharp twinge of pain from her head, this time only bad enough to make her wince. She let go of Loretta and stepped back. Loretta watched, still frozen in shock.</p>
            <p>“I’m going home. I have to prepare for my duties as a priest for tomorrow's service. Be on time, or don’t come at all.”</p>
            <p>With that, Krause turned on her heel and walked away.</p>
