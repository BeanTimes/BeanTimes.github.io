                Unfortunately, I have not known much peace since Dijon. The struggle against the Beans has been raging ever since, and my company has not been what I would consider peaceful. Maybe it is for the best; if I was at peace, I may have already given up.

            <p>Krause was awoken by a frantic knocking at her door. As she opened her eyes, she could see Henry already getting up from their bed and making his way towards the door. Annemarie was crying in her crib. As she rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, she heard a woman at the door. “Good morning Henry, is Jules there? I need to speak with her.”</p>
            <p>“Loretta?” Henry replied. “What are you doing here so early?”</p>
            <p>Loretta avoided his question. “I really need to talk with Jules. It’s important.”</p>
            <p>“Hey, Julia, are you awake?” Henry called into the cottage. “It’s Loretta, she wants to talk to you about something.”</p>
            <p>Krause began to get up from her bed, noticing the outline of Loretta standing in the early morning twilight just outside the door, blocked slightly by Henry. The sky was a beautiful shade of dark purple, the rising sun providing the countryside with just enough light to see the ground. She yawned “I’ll be right there, just let me get my shoes on.”</p>
            <p>Henry moved towards the crib, leaving Loretta standing in the doorway. “I’ll get the little devil back to sleep while you ladies talk.”</p>
            <p>“I think it would be best if we went for a walk. We might be talking for a while.” Loretta said, remaining motionless in the doorway. Krause couldn’t see her face in the dark, but her voice was tense.</p>
            <p>“What’s this about?” Henry asked. “The sun hasn’t even risen yet.”</p>
            <p>“It’s about… my husband.”</p>
            <p>“If he’s still causing you trouble, I could go have a word with him. I’m sure I could help persuade him to you better, Loretta.”</p>
            <p>“No, it’s alright. Thank you, Henry.” Loretta said as she and Krause exited the cottage, Loretta walking into the countryside. Krause closed the door behind her, glaring at Loretta’s back as she followed.</p>
            <p>They walked from the cottage in the general direction of Horb. Krause’s cottage was in the farmland on the outskirts of the village, and the nearest neighbor was nearly a kilometer away. Once they were out of view of the cottage, they would be completely alone.</p>
            <p>The early morning sky was beautiful.</p>
            <p>Loretta was silent. She kept glancing back towards the cottage and looking around, as though she was afraid of being overheard. Eventually, she came to a stop, surrounded by nearly ripe cabbages. She turned back towards Krause, opening her mouth to talk.</p>
            <p>Krause reached up, slapping Loretta hard enough that she fell backwards into the crops, the hit echoing through the eerily silent farmland. “How many times.” Krause said with a dangerous calm. “How many times do I have to tell you. Do not come to my house. What if Henry becomes suspicious? Heavens, he’s already suspicious! How long do you think it will be before he goes to talk some sense into George and he realizes that our stupid little meetings haven’t been about your silly housewife nonsense?”</p>
            <p>Loretta lay silently in the cabbages, barely holding back pained sobs.</p>
            <p>“Answer me, Loretta.”</p>
            <p>Silence.</p>
            <p>“I’m waiting.”</p>
            <p>Loretta remained silent, besides her sharp, pained sobs.</p>
            <p>Krause kneeled down towards Loretta, reaching her hand out. She recoiled in a panic at the sight of Krause’s hand. “Hush…” Krause cooed, similarly to how she would have talked to Annemarie if she was throwing a tantrum. “I’m not going to hit you again, don’t worry.” Loretta relaxed slightly, letting Krause wipe the tears that were now freely flowing down her cheeks.</p>
            <p>Loretta gasped between sharp sobs. “I’m sorry… Jules… it’ just… you’ve changed so---”</p>
            <p>Krause slapped her other cheek, knocking her back into the cabbages. “Answer me.” Her voice was calm and cold.</p>
            <p>She let Loretta sob for a moment, her face among the cabbages. Once she began to calm down, Krause began to run her hand through her hair.</p>
            <p>“You know what could happen if anyone finds out.” Krause said. “I’m trying to protect you, Loretta, but you just make it so hard. Now, what was it you wanted to tell me? What was so important that you had to put everything in danger, yet again? I’m telling you, you’ve been so… bad these past few days.”</p>
            <p>“It’s…” Loretta gasped between sharp sobs, turning to look at Krause. “It’s started. They’re moving east. The pastor told us, at this morning’s service. He says we should all evacuate to Stuttgart---”</p>
            <p>Krause raised her hand swiftly. Loretta yelped, closing her eyes and gritting her teeth, preparing to be hit again. Krause left her hand in the air. Slowly, Loretta reopened her eyes. “I know that already, Loretta. You do remember that they chose me, right? It was only a few days ago, you should still remember. It’s really not difficult.”</p>
            <p>“I remember...”</p>
            <p>“Since they chose me, God Himself has been communing with me through dreams.”</p>
            <p>Loretta lay in silence, waiting for Krause to continue.</p>
            <p>“Do you know what He told me?”</p>
            <p>“No...”</p>
            <p>“In my dream this morning, which you so rudely interrupted, by the way, He showed me them advancing. I saw it.They’re moving towards us as we speak, and nothing can stop them.” Krause smiled a large, toothy smile, her hand still hovering in the air above Loretta’s face. “Isn’t it excellent?”</p>
            <p>Loretta lay in silence among the cabbages.</p>
            <p>Krause slapped Loretta again as hard as she could.</p>
            <p>Loretta’s sobs were slightly muffled by the hand that was covering her cheek and wiping snot flowing from her nose. “Yes, yes Jules, it’s <i>excellent</i>.”</p>
            <p>“I’m glad you agree.” Krause said as she stood up, brushing the dirt and bits of cabbage off of her sleeping clothes. “Was that everything?”</p>
            <p>“Yes...”</p>
            <p>Krause reached her hand down to Loretta. She stared at her hand for a moment, then reached out to grab it. Krause helped her to her feet, then turned and began to walk back towards her cottage, not waiting for Loretta.</p>
            <p>“Jules…” Loretta’s voice was pleading now behind her. “You need to head east. If you don’t, they’re going to kill us along with everyone else here. How are we supposed to spread the Beanmeister’s---”</p>
            <p>Krause, now ten meters away, spun around quick enough to startle Loretta, who flinched despite the distance between them. Krause stood for a moment quietly, then took a deep breath. “You shouldn’t say His name.” Her voice was quiet. “You’re not allowed to say His name.”</p>
            <p>“We can’t spread <i>His</i> word if we’re dead, Julia.” Loretta spat.</p>
            <p>Krause laughed for a moment, her toothy smile visible in the early morning twilight. “I have no intention of dying <i>here</i>, Loretta. Our plan... <i>His</i> plan… is incredible. It saddens me that you won’t be able to see it completed.” She paused for a moment, staring at Loretta’s outline in the dark. Krause turned back towards her cottage. “If you want to run, you can. Don’t expect mercy from Him if you do, though.”</p>
            <p>Loretta’s voice was shrill. “You’re a fool, Julia Krause! The Jules I knew wouldn’t be acting like this! Think about Annemarie and Henry! You’re going to get them killed!”</p>
            <p>Krause ignored her response, instead making her way back toward her cottage. As she walked, she couldn’t help but notice again how beautiful the sky looked. His kingdom really was beautiful.</p>
            <p>When Krause opened the door to her cottage, she noticed Henry sitting at the table, holding Annemarie in the light of a small candle. When he noticed her, he stood and asked “Are you alright, Jules? You’re covered in dirt, let me help you.”</p>
            <p>Krause waved her hand dismissively. “I’m alright, honey.” She cooed. “I just fell when walking with Loretta is all. I’ll brush myself off before I come in.”</p>
            <p>“What did she want to talk about?” Henry asked.</p>
            <p>“I don’t know… you know how she’s been lately. She started talking about some silly rumor she heard, but I was so tired I could barely pay attention! And don’t worry, honey, it had nothing to do with George, she just uses that excuse to get me alone with her. How’s the little devil doing?”</p>
            <p>“She wouldn’t fall back asleep, so I’ve been playing with her.”</p>
            <p>Annemarie cooed from Henry’s arms at the sight of her mother.</p>
            <p>“I guess it’s too late to fall back asleep. Would you like for me to make you breakfast?”</p>
            <p>“That would be wonderful.” Henry replied.</p>
