                If I have one legitimate regret, it would be not appreciating my time in Dijon more. The more I look back at my life, the more I realize that I have a habit of seeing the worst of things. I can only wish that is what I am doing with the Beans now. There has to be a silver lining somewhere, right? Otherwise, I would not be writing this now.

            <p>Schmidt watched as Captain Bösch stood in silence, waiting for the soldiers and civilians to gather as he nursed his worsening headache.</p>
            <p>Bösch, Dietrich, Sauer, and Gladisch were among the group that stood in front of the increasing crowd of soldiers. Bösch stood on a small table taken from the nearby market, his face easily visible from within the crowd. The gunfire had stopped for the moment, as Bösch had given the order for every soldier to gather and prepare to execute an escape plan, though the banging on the gates continued.</p>
            <p>The absurdity of the events that morning was juxtaposed with the seriousness of Bösch, his silver mustache waving slightly in the breeze as he stood stern atop his table, his polished plate armor shining brilliantly in the morning sun.</p>
            <p>Rob stood next to him, uncharacteristically quiet. He was still shaking slightly, his face hard, his arms crossed over his stomach. He glanced at Schmidt, giving him a small, nervous smirk. If they weren’t about to die, they would have been poking fun at Bösch for standing on a table in the middle of town.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, they were about to die, so they were not poking fun at Bösch. Instead, Schmidt was alone with the thoughts that he had been avoiding since he first saw the Beans outside Dijon. Though he tried his hardest to push them out of his mind, one question in particular kept coming back to him. Why was he so afraid to fight?</p>
            <p>Even when he was manning the cannons with Rob, he felt like he shouldn’t have been there, like he should have been somewhere far, far away. Maybe in Rohrdorf, or somewhere else in the world entirely. Anywhere but Dijon. As he fought the Beans, he felt like a prisoner within his own body, his arms and legs moving on their own, his fear and despair clouding his mind. With all the commotion, he hadn’t had a chance to think about why he felt the way he did, though, now that he could, he was finding it increasingly difficult to answer that question.</p>
            <p>Like Rob had said, this was exactly what he wanted. When he woke up to the commotion in the army camp this morning, he was happy that something was finally happening, fully prepared to sacrifice his life for the greater good of his fellow soldiers and finally leave everything behind. He had been planning his sacrifice, his final blaze of glory, for as long as he could remember. He thought about it for so long that he could barely remember the reason why he wanted to sacrifice himself in the first place.</p>
            <p>Something in the last few, short hours had changed inside him. He had made a deal with Rob that he wouldn’t let himself die, but when he agreed he wasn’t seriously considering honoring it. If a good enough chance had come, he knew that he would have taken it. At least, he would have if his enemies were normal soldiers with muskets and cannons instead of whatever the Beans were.</p>
            <p>At least, that’s what he told himself. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that maybe he wouldn’t have sacrificed himself, even if he was fighting humans. The more he thought about fighting, about dying for his fellow soldiers, he only grew more afraid. He always thought about his death as though it were a story being told years after, never stopping to consider what he would have had to endure to make his sacrifice a reality.</p>
            <p>That reality became more and more distinct with each step the huge Bean monster took towards Dijon. Every few seconds, the ground shook from its steps, and all they were doing was standing in the middle of the street, waiting for Bösch to explain his plan.</p>
            <p>Schmidt put his head in his hands.</p>
            <p>He had been a fool. Everything would have been much easier if he had stayed in Rohrdorf with Sofia. Everything would have been so much easier… but he wasn’t in Rohrdorf, and things weren’t easy. Maybe everything would be easier if he just gave up, ended his own suffering instead of waiting for the Beans to end it for him. There were muskets everywhere, and Sofia would never find out how he died.</p>
            <p>Schmidt slowly became aware of the anxious whispers of the soldiers around him getting more and more restless. Some were angry that Bösch had stopped them from fighting, others were relieved for the short rest, but the majority of the soldiers were just as scared as Schmidt, too terrified to face the reality of their own deaths, using all of their energy to simply wait for the escape plan to be explained and to decide whether or not to hold on to the tiny sliver of hope they had left.</p>
            <p>“ATTENTIOOON!” Bösch shouted from the front of the crowd, making Schmidt jump. As he lowered his hands from his face, he realized they were wet with tears. Bösch cleared his throat loudly and continued. He still stood on the table, and despite everything, it made Schmidt laugh softly to himself. “The monsters that attack us will henceforth be referred to as Beans! We have developed a plan to not only escape Dijon, but also return valuable information about the Beans to the rest of the Empire.”</p>
            <p>Whispers broke out among the soldiers. “The plan is as follows: First, we will gather five cannons and aim them towards the eastern gate. We will shoot them all at once, destroying the gate and any Beans lying in wait on the other side. From there, we will move towards the stables near our camp, and escape to Stuttgart using horses. With our current knowledge, even a moderate run can easily outpace the Beans.”</p>
            <p>The whispers among the soldiers continued, the banging at the gates punctuating each of Bösch’s sentences. “I know this plan sounds insane, and not particularly well thought out. That’s because it is. However, I feel that this plan will provide the best chance for our collective survival. I have spent the last year getting to know each and every one of you personally. I know that you want to see your families and your friends again. I know that you’re scared. I know that many of you would rather hide within the walls, fighting against the increasing swarm of Beans outside than think about retreating and tarnishing your honor.”</p>
            <p>Bösch continued, ignoring the soldiers shouting in agreement. “To that, I say you’re a fool. There are no reinforcements coming to save us. Retreat is the only sensible strategy, no matter how dishonorable it may be. The decision you make now is the only thing between you and oblivion. I have chosen to put my faith in this plan. You can choose to refuse to follow me, to hide within these walls and try to survive in vain.”</p>
            <p>Bösch paused. “Or, you can choose to follow me. I will not allow any more of my brothers in arms to die needlessly against these unholy abominations. We can escape this town alive. If you’re unable to put your faith in our plan, then put your faith in me.”</p>
            <p>He paused again, standing confidently atop his table, looking towards the now silent audience. “Follow me in retreat. Retreat and live. Live to fight another day.”</p>
            <p>Everyone was silent for a moment, the only sounds being the banging at the gates and the periodic footsteps of the huge Bean monster that was slowly approaching Dijon. Schmidt stood, stunned at Bösch’s speech. In all the time he had known him, none of Bösch’s speeches had ever made Schmidt feel the way he felt now.</p>
            <p>Maybe they really could leave Dijon alive.</p>
            <p>Dietrich took a step towards the crowd, turning to face Bösch. “You are a fool, Humbert. A fool and a coward.” Dietrich turned to face the crowd of soldiers, who whispered among each other. Civilians stood with the soldiers, confused and terrified. “He says he has grown to know you, yet he is willing to sacrifice your lives to allow himself to escape. He wants to run and hide behind more soldiers and bigger walls when we are standing on the front lines, ready and able to fight against these monsters. You men have wives. You men have children. Your wives, your children, even these French civilians, all of them are depending on you to fight, to protect them against these monsters. We are the only thing between them and other men just like yourselves, men with families, men with children. If the coward Humbert Bösch is unwilling to fight to protect those men, those women, those children… then I will.” Dietrich turned back to face Bösch.</p>
            <p>“You’re free to choose your own fate, Markus,” Bösch said after a moment, returning Dietrich’s glare with a solemn stare. “I will not stop you.”</p>
            <p>“Fool,” Dietrich spat as he began walking towards the western gate. Some soldiers followed Dietrich, shouting insults at Bösch as they left. Others started towards the eastern gate, shouting insults at the soldiers insulting Bösch. Most of the soldiers stood in Dijon’s main street, debating with each other about which side they should choose. Schmidt and Rob stood silently in the middle of the street as the other soldiers moved around them.</p>
            <p>“What do you think?” Rob asked after a moment, turning towards Schmidt. “I… I get what Captain Bösch is saying, but… do you really think it’s the right choice? Should we really run? We’re here to fight, aren’t we? Lieutenant Dietrich was right, we can’t just let those things walk into a major city… it’d be a bloodbath... But then why does the Captain want to run? He has to know what running would mean, what would happen if we just leave these things out here...”</p>
            <p>Schmidt stood for a moment, glancing between the western and eastern gates. Fight or run... Die or survive... He thought of Sofia, and what would happen to her if the Beans were able to get to Rohrdorf. He thought of all the people that would go through the same pain, the same suffering he was going through now, if the Beans were to advance any further.</p>
            <p>Who was he kidding. He had made his decision the moment he saw the Beans. “I hate to say it, but I agree with Bösch. We can’t fight them,” he replied as he moved towards the eastern gate. Rob stared at his back, glancing over his shoulder at the western gate. He sighed and followed Schmidt.</p>
            <p>As he walked to the east, Schmidt noticed Sauer and Gladisch arguing with a small, timid looking man. “Wagner,” Sauer pleaded. “Don’t be foolish. If you follow that man, you will die.”</p>
            <p>Gladisch shook her head slowly. “Sauer is right. Please, Bernard. Come with us.”</p>
            <p>Wagner’s breathing was erratic, his face wet with tears. “I don’t want to die… I can’t… I can’t go with you… I’m sorry…” He began to walk to the western gate.</p>
            <p>Sauer sighed, his face hard. Gladisch put her hand on his back, and they stood together in silence for a moment. Eventually, they both walked east.</p>
            <p>Less than half of the remaining soldiers had chosen to follow Bösch in retreat. Schmidt recognized a lot of them from his time in Dijon, but there were many more people that had chosen to follow Dietrich. He could see the soldiers preparing the cannons on the wall above the western gate, three hundred meters away. He would never see them again.</p>
            <p>“I was expecting more...” Bösch said simply, walking towards the eastern gate to begin setting his plan in motion.</p>
            <p>The next hour was a blur to Schmidt. Again, he felt like a prisoner within his own body, his arms and legs helping the other soldiers move the five cannons into position on their own. He was vaguely aware of the cannon blasts from the soldiers in the west, the droning banging at the gates, and the increasingly violent shaking from each of the Bean monster’s steps as it slowly approached Dijon. His heart was racing inside his chest, his breaths not seeming to completely fill his lungs.</p>
            <p>The sun was high in the sky before the cannons were finally in position. Bösch ordered five soldiers to prepare the cannons, while the remaining soldiers would stand a short distance behind them, muskets ready to shoot whatever was on the other side of the gate.</p>
            <p>Schmidt’s trance was finally broken when Bösch was preparing to give the order to fire. He blinked, tightening his grip on his musket and looking at the soldiers standing around him. But they weren't looking at the eastern gate.</p>
            <p>They were looking west.</p>
            <p>“My God…” Rob gasped, following the other soldiers’ eyes. Despite the fear forming in the center of his chest, Schmidt turned around.</p>
            <p>He wasn’t sure what to expect, but it sure as <i>hell</i> was not what he saw.</p>
            <p>The huge Bean monster was towering over the western gate. Soldiers scrambled around the wall, desperately shooting cannonballs into the chest of the monster, attempting to slow it down before it reached the wall. The monster’s next step was so forceful that the buildings around Schmidt shook violently.</p>
            <p>Then, the monster stopped.</p>
            <p>The cannons above the western wall blasted all at once, launching a volley of cannonballs directly into the monster’s chest.</p>
            <p>The monster released a wet, deafening roar, similar to the screams they heard west of Dijon that morning, though the monster’s roar was deep enough that it caused the bell above the chapel to ring.</p>
            <p>As it roared, the monster slowly crossed its unnaturally long arms over its chest, blocking the next volley of cannonballs. There were lines of steam drifting out from where each shot hit the monster.</p>
            <p>The monster’s roar died out. The soldiers in the west prepared their cannons again as the soldiers in the east watched.</p>
            <p>Schmidt held his breath.</p>
            <p>And then the wall was gone.</p>
            <p>One moment, the monster’s arms were crossed in front of its chest. The next moment, the monster’s arms were spread out, both lodged with pieces of broken wood and stone.</p>
            <p>Where the western gate once stood was nothing. Bloodstained chunks of stone, splintered wood, and the remains of cannons were blasted into the empty town as the Bean monster’s arms swept effortlessly through twenty meters of Dijon’s wall. Twisted corpses left streaks of red behind as they flew through the morning sky. Schmidt watched as the shattered remnants of the wall flew into Dijon. A cannon was launched into the chapel, the bell clanging as it fell into the center of the main street. In the market, a bloody boulder crushed the kind vendor lady’s stall. A corpse fell onto the ground twenty meters in front of Schmidt with a sickening slap.</p>
            <p>The Bean monster slowly lowered its arms. From the gaping hole in the wall, smaller Beans began walking in. They moved with caution as they navigated through the rubble now littering the main street.</p>
            <p>And then everything was silent.</p>
            <p>Schmidt let out the breath he was holding.</p>
            <p>“SHOOT, GOD DAMN IT!” Bösch screamed. “SHOOT THE CANNONS!”</p>
            <p>Two of the five soldiers lit the fuse on their cannons. The two blasts rang out over the panicked shouts of the soldiers, launching cannonballs into the eastern gate. The other three soldiers, shocked into action by the blasts, lit their own cannons, launching three more cannonballs into the already damaged gate.</p>
            <p>The gate blasted open, trailing splinters of wood through the road. The Empire camp was deserted, except for the crowd of twenty Beans that stood among the tents. One cannonball left a gaping hole in the side of a sleeping tent.. A few of the Beans were crippled by the cannonballs, leaving them lying broken on the ground, though the rest were preparing to attack.</p>
            <p>Schmidt glanced at Rob. His eyes were wide, his musket ready. Bösch began to run through the broken gate, his own musket aimed at the Bean closest to him. Some soldiers followed him. Sauer shoved his journal into his cloak, his face looking scarier than usual.</p>
            <p>Schmidt didn’t move.</p>
            <p>Bösch shouted as he shot a Bean, smoke rising from the barrel of his musket. “WE RIDE FOR STUTTGART,” he shouted as he used his musket as a club, hitting a second Bean in the head and knocking it to the ground. He turned towards the motionless group of soldiers. “WHAT THE <i>HELL</i> ARE YOU PEOPLE WAITING FOR?”</p>
            <p>Without thinking, Schmidt ran towards the eastern gate.</p>
