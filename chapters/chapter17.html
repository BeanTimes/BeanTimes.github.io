                October 17th, 1587 - Horb, Holy Roman Empire
            </h2>
            <div id="div-line-long"></div>
            <h3>
                The Empire had more than two hundred soldiers in Dijon before the attack. We left with less than thirty. In little more than six hours, the Beans were able to destroy ninety percent of our forces.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Krause thought it was much too early in the morning for what they were doing.</p>
            <p>An order from the Holy Roman Army commanded everyone to start evacuating further east to avoid monsters called the Beans. According to the order, the Beans had already taken over a majority of French territory as far as Dijon, and the army anticipated that they could continue farther east at any moment. As a precaution, the Empire wanted as few civilians near the Beans as possible.</p>
            <p>Krause knew all of this, of course. She was happy about it. She had seen the advancing of the Beans in her dreams, and she was proud that she was able to be a part of something so beautiful.</p>
            <p>What she was not happy about was the fact that they were not allowed to remain in Horb. The villagers of Horb, a tiny village nearly three hundred kilometers away from Dijon, were forced to be evacuated to Stuttgart, where they would assist the Empire’s efforts against the Beans. Henry would help grow crops to feed the soldiers of the town, and Krause would help mend and sew clothes for them.</p>
            <p>Krause had tried her best to convince Henry that they should stay. She insisted that they stay in Horb, telling Henry that she would miss the life they had and that she didn’t want to uproot Annemarie during her formative years. If only Henry had accepted the Church, then he would know why they had to stay. He had still not accepted the Beans, though, so he could never understand.</p>
            <p>That was a few weeks ago. One day, she had woken up and finally accepted that she had to move. She still didn’t like it, but she realized that even if Henry had agreed, the army wouldn’t be as understanding. They had finished packing their boxes late the night before, and had immediately prepared to begin their journey to Stuttgart. All they needed to do before leaving Horb forever was to finish packing their carriage.</p>
            <p>She had made her final preparations with the Church a few days ago. The members of Horb’s branch of the Church would go about their new lives in Stuttgart normally until contacted by a member of Stuttgart’s branch. Pastor Schäfer had told Krause that he was in contact with a high ranking member of the Church named Aaron, who would be organizing the evacuees in Stuttgart. Schäfer wasn’t sure how long it would take for Aaron to contact Horb’s members, and he made it clear that they should not seek out the Church when they arrived.</p>
            <p>Annemarie slept peacefully in a makeshift crib outside the carriage. Krause smiled at her daughter as she placed the box she was carrying into the carriage. She wiped the sweat from her forehead and walked over to Henry, who was taking a break on their front step.</p>
            <p>“It’s a shame, isn’t it?” Henry asked, smiling sadly at her. “They didn’t even let me harvest the cabbage. At least we’re getting room and board in Stuttgart. Still, though...”</p>
            <p>Krause sat down next to him. She played with her necklace pensively, thinking about her life in Horb. “I’m sure going to miss this place. I think watching the sunrise was my favorite part about living here.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t forget the little devil. She was my favorite part about living here. It feels like she was born just yesterday… Now look at her. These past three years have really flown right by us, haven’t they?”</p>
            <p>“Stop it Henry, you’re going to make me cry!” Krause said, playfully hitting him in the shoulder. She sighed. “I think I’m going on a walk to town.”</p>
            <p>Henry’s smile wavered. “Are you sure? We’re almost done packing, and we should head out as soon as we can. We should leave before the soldiers come back, they won’t be too happy that we still haven’t left yet.”</p>
            <p>“I know, it’s just… Who knows if we'll ever return? I’m going to miss it here, and I don’t want my final memories to be of me crying in a carriage.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll come with you, then. Our last memories here can be of us, together.”</p>
            <p>Krause laughed, wiping a small tear from her cheek. “Oh no, I don’t think so. You just want to comfort me when I start crying. Well I don’t want you to see me cry, mister.”</p>
            <p>“Alright, alright,” Henry said. “But please be quick. We should leave soon.”</p>
            <p>Krause nodded, smiling first at Henry, then at Annemarie. Even if this was the right thing to do, she was still sad about leaving everything behind. No… not everything. She still had Henry and Annemarie. Even if they didn’t believe in the Church, they still loved her.</p>
            <p>The cool morning air pushed against her and she felt the slight slickness of the early morning grass under her as she made her way into town. There were very few people left. Many had evacuated as soon as the news of the Beans reached them, believing the situation was much worse than it actually was.</p>
            <p>Krause walked past the empty buildings and, for a second, felt an overwhelming melancholy. Horb was not much, but it was still their home. This feeling remained as the empty marketplace came into view. One that, before now, would have been busting with people going about their lives. As she approached, she saw the empty stalls where there would normally be produce, meats, and other goods. She and Henry had sold their produce there once, before Annemarie was born and Krause had to focus on taking care of her. Her melancholy deepend as she continued towards the Oratory of Saint Maria.</p>
            <p>As she pushed open the oratory’s doors and walked inside, she was greeted by the dozen or so remaining congregation and Pastor Schäfer. This was to be the final meeting of Horb’s branch of the Church of the Beanmeister before assimilating into Stuttgart’s branch.</p>
            <p>“Julia! Lovely to see you, we were wondering if you would show,” said Pastor Schäfer. “Difficult times, these are…”</p>
            <p>“Of course I would. I am a priest in this congregation, after all. Preparing our carriage took a while longer than I expected, that's all.” Krause made her way to the front of the church, where the rest of the congregation was gathered. As she approached, she noticed that one of the men was unfamiliar to her.</p>
            <p>Schäfer continued. “Now, everyone should have plans to leave for Stuttgart no later than tomorrow. The soldiers have already become suspicious of many of us for waiting so long to leave. The journey should take no longer than a day. Once we arrive, and I can not stress this enough, you should <i>not</i> seek out the Church. The Church will send members to inform you of meeting times and dates over the next month or two. The army has found some of our branches, and they don’t like what we are doing. This is the best way for the Church to remain secretive.”</p>
            <p>“And what if they forget about us, and can’t find us?” asked the new member.</p>
            <p>“Don’t worry, Sam. Everything will work out, in time,” Schäfer replied.</p>
            <p>“How can we believe that, though?” Sam asked.</p>
            <p>“Aaron, the leader of Stuttgart’s branch, is a talented man. He has been planning many different branch acquisitions since the first Bean attack, Horb’s acquisition among them. It may take some time, but have faith in me, in Aaron, and in the Beanmeister.”</p>
            <p>Krause glanced at the other members of the congregation. She didn’t know who Aaron was, and by the looks on everyone else's faces, they didn’t either. “And why should we trust this Aaron?” Krause asked.</p>
            <p>“You dare question Pastor Schäfer, you dare question the <i>Beanmeister</i>?” Gloria replied, glaring at Krause. “This is nothing more than a test of faith. Those who question the will of God are not worthy to be accepted by Him. I can’t believe that you’re a priest, Julia. You speak as though you joined the Church just yesterday.”</p>
            <p>“I was proven worthy the moment Pastor Schäfer inducted me into the clergy. If you call me a heretic, then by your logic, the Beanmeister was too foolish to see my true nature,” Krause replied.</p>
            <p>Gloria’s face went red with anger. Her voice was loud and sharp. “First you question Pastor Schäfer, then the Beanmeister, then <i>me</i>? And you deem yourself---”</p>
            <p>“Ladies,” Pastor Schäfer held his hands up calmly. “Ladies, please. We are in the house of the Lord. I will not have accusations of unfaithfulness be thrown around so freely. We are all the Beanmeister’s children, and we should treat each other as such.”</p>
            <p>Gloria balled her fists, holding one out to Krause. She looked as though she was going to say something else, then sighed and left the church.</p>
            <p>“To answer your question, Julia, you have no reason to trust Aaron besides my word. Although my word is not nearly as strong as the word of the Lord, I have been told to spread this word by the Lord Himself. He is giving us a chance to move onward, to spread his word to an even larger audience, and I feel as though we should.” Schäfer paused, smiling at the congregation gathered before him. “As it is said in Thessalonians, ‘Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.’ We, the true believers in the word of God, will be saved! Do not lose faith!”</p>
            <p>As Schäfer spoke, Krause thought of Loretta. She had left Horb as soon as the news about the Beans arrived a few weeks ago. Krause had not spoken to Loretta since she had arrived at Krause’s house to warn her about the advancing Beans, their final conversation being their fight in the cabbage field.</p>
            <p>“Pastor, what will happen to the unbelievers?” Krause heard herself asking.</p>
            <p>“What do you mean?” Schäfer asked.</p>
            <p>“I fear that… some of my loved ones do not truly believe in the Church or the word of the Beanmeister. My husband has denounced the Church since its inception, and Loretta Gardner, a member of our congregation, was among the first people to leave Horb once news of the Beans arrived. Will they be punished, or will He spare them?”</p>
            <p>“That is a… difficult question. Truthfully, we do not know what Loretta or your husband think. If you care about them so deeply, then they must be reasonable people that will be able to see the truth behind the Beanmeister’s words, in time. It is understandable why many would be afraid to accept such a seemingly radical truth, when they do not have access to all of the information. The Lord will forgive them for their shortcomings, for He is merciful. Do not fear.”</p>
            <p>There were some murmurs of agreement among the remaining congregation. The new member, Sam, spoke up. “I believe that the Lord will not punish anyone unjustly, for He is an understanding and tolerant God.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you, Sam,” Pastor Schäfer smiled. “Now, if no one has any other question or concerns regarding our assimilation into Stuttgart’s branch of the Church…”</p>
            <p>When no one replied, Pastor Schäfer dismissed the congregation. After the meeting, Krause approached Sam, holding out her hand. “Welcome to the Church of the Beanmeister, Sam. It’s a pleasure to have you.”</p>
            <p>Sam smiled awkwardly. “Oh, you know. I wanted to see what the Beanmeister stood for, after the news came. I’m Sam Brandt, by the way. I’ll do anything I can to help out around here.”</p>
            <p>“Julia Krause.” They shook hands, Sam avoiding eye contact. “I haven’t seen you here before, are you new to the Church?”</p>
            <p>“I’ve been to a few meetings. I’ve talked with Pastor Schäfer alone to learn more about the Beans, and I think I understand everything that’s been going on. I haven’t seen you here before.”</p>
            <p>“I’ve been busy recently, so I haven’t had time to come. You see, my husband doesn’t agree with my involvement with the Church, and I have a young daughter that I have to take care of. But the Church is still very important in my life.”</p>
            <p>Sam had begun to move away slowly. “Yeah, yeah the Church is pretty important. I’m sorry, but I can’t stay around much longer. It was nice meeting you, Julia.”</p>
            <p>“It was nice meeting you too, Sam. I’m sure we’ll meet again in Stuttgart.”</p>
            <p>As Krause watched Sam exit the church, she decided that it was time for her to leave as well. The sun outside was warm, the air crisp. She took the long way home, savoring her final walk through Horb. She really would miss it.
