            <h3>
                From what I understand, everything began in the year 1584 in Paris, the capital city of the Kingdom of France.

            <p>Krause thought it was much too early in the morning for what they were doing. However, an order from General Krüger told everyone that they should start evacuating the city. According to the news, monsters called the Beans had reached as far as Dijon, and soldiers were holding Besançon. It was decided that the Beans were soon to be a threat to the citizens of Horb. They were evacuating to Stuttgart, a city that was ready to accomodate more people.</p>
            <p>According to the order, they would be able to live in Stuttgart in return for assisting the effort against the Beans. Henry would help grow crops to feed the soldiers of the town, and Krause would help mend and sew clothes for them. Fortunately, they both already knew how to do those jobs, so it was not too large of a change for them.</p>
            <p>Krause hadn’t initially wanted to leave. She insisted that they stay in Horb, telling Henry it was because she would miss the life they had and didn’t want to uproot Annemarie. Truthfully, though, she did not want to leave the Church. Of course, Henry had not accepted the Beans, so he didn’t understand. Krause only agreed to move after the Church officials informed her that they would be joining a congregation that had already been established in Stuttgart. After receiving that news, she went home and agreed to leave with Henry.</p>
            <p>She feels that it was odd how quickly she had changed her mind. She had been so reluctant to leave, down to her bones she knew she couldn’t leave. However, when she heard about the other congregation in Stuttgart, and how there would be so many people, she suddenly felt called towards it.</p>
            <p>They had started packing quickly and were finally ready to leave this morning, just needing to get the last of their belongings packed on their carriage. Krause looked over at Annemarie, who was sleeping soundly in a makeshift crib. She walked over to Henry.</p>
            <p>“Honey, I’m going on a walk to town.”</p>
            <p>Henry paused, looking up from the clothes he was folding and turned to her.“Are you sure? We’re almost done and should head out as soon as we can. We have stayed here much too long, in my opinion.”</p>
            <p>“I am sure. I’m going to miss this place... Who knows if we will ever return?” She said.</p>
            <p>“Fine,” he relented, “But please be quick. We need to leave soon.”</p>
            <p>Krause nodded silently at that before turning and walking out the door. The cool morning air pushing against her. She began walking towards the town, feeling the slight slickness of the grass beneath her feet, still wet with dew. As she approached the town, she saw very few people. Many had left as soon as the news reached them, believing the situation to be much worse than it was. Krause laughed at their stupidity, for she knew the truth.</p>
            <p>Krause walked past the empty buildings and, for a second, felt sad about leaving. It was not much, but it was their home. She saw the empty marketplace come into view. One that, before now, would be bustling with people going about their lives. As she approached, she saw the empty stalls where there would normally be produce. She and Henry had sold there once, before deciding it was too much of a hassle on top of the farm, and paid others to sell for them. She frowned, then continued walking through it towards the church.</p>
            <p>As she pushed open the church’s doors and walked inside, she was greeted by a priest and the few remaining congregation. She had agreed to meet them before she left town so they could go over their plans to join the Church in Stuttgart, and how they would gather new members.</p>
            <p>“Krause! Lovely to see you. We were wondering if you would show,” said Pastor Schäfer.</p>
            <p>“Of course I would, I am a priest in this congregation. Preparing to leave took a while longer than expected is all.” Krause walked to the first row of pews, where everyone was gathered.</p>
            <p>“Now, we are leaving for Stuttgart by tomorrow. The journey will take about a day. Once we are there, we will want to regroup and begin to work,” said Schäfer.</p>
            <p>“Do you know where we will be meeting for our services?” asked Sam Brandt, who was sitting in the front, earnestly watching Schäfer. Sam was a more recent member to the church, but a loyal one.</p>
            <p>“Not yet, I’m afraid. We are going to meet with Aaron once we get there, he said he knows a place for us to hold our sermons.”</p>
            <p>Krause glanced at the other members of the congregation. She didn’t know who Aaron was, but since everyone else didn’t seem confused by the mention of him, she did not ask.</p>
            <p>“Do you think this is a test of our faith?” Asked Gloria Albrecht. Gloria joined the church shortly after Krause became a priest. Though she had doubts about Gloria at first, she had quickly proven herself to be a valuable member of the congregation, working up the ranks and becoming an acolyte only a week after Krause became a priest.</p>
            <p>“Partially, yes, though I like to see it as an opportunity for growth. The Lord himself is giving us a chance to move onward and spread his word.” As Schafer spoke, Krause felt very strongly that this was true. “As it is said in Thessalonians, ‘Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.’ We, the true believers in the word of God, will be saved! Do not lose faith!.”</p>
            <p>As Schafer spoke, Krause remembered Loretta. She had left town a few weeks ago, as soon as news arrived about the Beans. They had not spoken since Loretta had come to warn her about the advancing Beans. Loretta was part of the first wave of people to leave, and it annoyed Krause.</p>
            <p>“What will happen to Loretta?” Krause asked, cutting through the silence.</p>
            <p>“What do you mean by that?” Asked Schafer.</p>
            <p>“I fear that Loretta doesn't truly believe in the church. She left town so quickly and she didn’t seem to have fully accepted the Lord. Will she be punished by Him?”</p>
            <p>“Well, that is a hard question. Truthfully, we do not know what Loretta thinks. As far as I see, she is a decent member of the Church, and I think the Lord will forgive her for her shortcomings, for He is merciful.”</p>
            <p>“Right, but... what if she doesn’t believe at all?”</p>
            <p>“That is hard to answer, dear. However, I am sure that the Lord will give her a chance,” said Schafer.</p>
            <p>“I believe that the Lord will not punish anyone unjustly,” said Gloria, fixing Krause with a reassuring smile.</p>
            <p>“Well, <i>I</i> think that all non believers should be punished. If you don’t accept the Lord, you should have to deal with the consequences,” said Sam.</p>
            <p>Krause flinched, glancing at Sam. She would have to talk to Loretta again about this, if she could find her in Stuttgart. Hopefully she would see the error in her ways and become a better member of the church.</p>
            <p>“If that is all, then I best be on my way,” said Krause after another moment of silence, “I will meet you all again in Stuttgart.”</p>
            <p>A chorus of agreement came from the others, and Krause started walking towards the door, followed by Sam and Gloria. She stepped outside into the warmth of the sun, which was now high enough to crest the buildings, and began walking through the town one last time.</p>
