                6am October 5th, 1587 - Dijon, Kingdom of France
            </h2>
            <div id="div-line-long"></div>
            <h3>
                The sunrise on the Ouche river really was breathtaking.
            </h3>
            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Sauer stood in silence. Behind him, the sun rose steadily. To the south, the Ouche river rambled peacefully through the French countryside. Next to him, his colleagues Wagner and Gladisch stood, terrified of what was going on merely a hundred meters in front of them.</p>
            <p>The soldiers were silent as the first shot was fired.</p>
            <p>They remained silent for a moment, watching as the dead body of an Empire scout was reanimated by a black mass that ran into the shadow of a tree. They finally began to move again when more black creatures began to emerge from the forest, moving steadily towards them.</p>
            <p>Sauer, Wagner, and Gladisch could not see what was going on, their view blocked by the army of soldiers and villagers in front of them. And the soldiers were terrified.</p>
            <p>Wagner whimpered, shaking so hard that his teeth clattered together. Gladisch frowned, looking towards the commotion as if the noise was only a mild inconvenience. Sauer had absolutely no idea what was happening, and stood confused as the commotion transpired around him.</p>
            <p>The soldiers began to shout over each other as they readied their muskets. The weaponless French villagers began to retreat towards the safety of Dijon’s walls, causing some Empire soldiers to follow. A few soldiers stood motionless in fear as they watched the monsters advance.</p>
            <p>A booming voice rang out with the practiced confidence of a man worthy of the title captain. “WITHDRAW TO THE WALLS OF DIJON. I REPEAT, THIS IS A STRATEGIC WITHDRAWAL TO THE WALLS OF DIJON. WE ARE THE ONLY THING BETWEEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF DIJON, AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM BE HARMED. THE ENEMY WILL OVERWHELM US IF WE DO NOT RETREAT.”</p>
            <p>As the soldiers began to slowly back up, their muskets aimed west towards the monsters emerging from the forest, Sauer felt his journal weighing down his breast pocket. He knew what he had to do. “We need to see what’s going on. We have to document this.”</p>
            <p>“How do you plan to do that,” Gladisch asked. Her voice had an unusual edge to it, despite her stern face.</p>
            <p>Though he was shaking violently, Wagner was able to stutter out “Are you insane? You’re going to die if you go up there! Whatever’s attacking us is going to kill you, kill everyone here! We should be retreating to the town walls!”</p>
            <p>“I would rather die documenting our enemy than survive knowing nothing about them,” Sauer replied.</p>
            <p>“This isn’t the time to be honorable, Thomas Sauer! You are going to die! What good will knowing bring you if you’re dead?” Wagner stuttered.</p>
            <p>“We were hired to do this... We have to at least try,” Gladisch decided. “I will go with you. We retreat at the first sign of danger.”</p>
            <p>“The first sign of danger? Captain Bösch calling for a retreat was the first sign of danger!” Wagner cried.</p>
            <p>“Thank you, Gladisch. Now, we should get over there before the situation gets worse,” Sauer said as they began to move towards the defences.</p>
            <p>“This isn’t worth dying for! Please, don’t do this!” Wagner called as he turned towards Dijon.</p>
            <p>As they approached the improvised defences, Sauer could tell that there was very little time before the soldiers were overrun. The soldiers were caught by surprise, making their attacks sloppy and inaccurate. The order to retreat from Bösch only added to the confusion, splitting their forces between a group that was holding off the monsters at the improvised defences and a group that was retreating towards Dijon.</p>
            <p>Sauer began to regret his decision, but his curiosity would not let him turn back now. Not when he was so close to finding out what, exactly, they were fighting.</p>
            <p>Sauer watched as the dark creatures moved between the shadows of the trees, heading steadily towards the soldiers. Though Sauer could tell that they were not human, in the poor early morning light he could not determine an exact reason why. Perhaps it was the way they moved, or the writhing, dark red outer shell that covered their eerily human bodies. Every so often, small clumps of the creature’s shells fell slowly to the ground.</p>
            <p>Though some of the creatures had already been shot, they continued to move forward with terrifying agility. The creatures would shamble behind a tree and hide in the shadows, allowing another creature to exit a different tree’s shadow moving the opposite direction, confusing the soldiers.</p>
            <p>“They… look so coordinated...” Sauer breathed to himself, writing notes in his journal.</p>
            <p>“It does seem that way,” Gladisch responded, standing next to Sauer.</p>
            <p>“Do you see that shell?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“Yes. It seems to be protecting them; when they are shot, a clump of their shell falls.” Sauer watched as a soldier shot a bullet in the shoulder of a monster, which left behind a steaming, fist sized clump of shell. He added that to his notes.</p>
            <p>“Can these creatures be killed with guns? Can they even die?” Sauer asked himself, though he knew Gladisch would respond anyway.</p>
            <p>“I do not know,” Gladisch replied.</p>
            <p>Sauer had been at the defences for less than a minute, but he already felt that he should be retreating towards the safety of Dijon’s walls. The creatures had made steady progress towards their defences, not deterred by the constant musket fire from the remaining soldiers. Sauer presumed that the fallen logs would do very little to stop the creatures if guns had no effect on them.</p>
            <p>Quickly, Sauer glanced down the line of soldiers that had stayed to fight the monsters. He knew Captain Bösch was somewhere with the soldiers since he could hear him trying to keep order among the chaos. The soldiers were not listening. As Sauer glanced at the soldiers, he recognized one of them.</p>
            <p>The horrified face of Barnabas Schmidt looked around frantically as he reloaded his musket. When his nervous eyes landed on Sauer, they made eye contact for a few seconds before Schmidt said “I told you so,” then laughed nervously, as though he was trying to ease the tension with a joke.</p>
            <p>Sauer was not in the mood for jokes.</p>
            <p>Before he could release his own tension by shouting at Schmidt, a soldier next to him yelled “God <i>damn</i> it Barry, this isn’t the time for telling us you told us so! Or did you think you had to do it before we became a pile of corpses, because we’re getting dangerously close to becoming that. Do you wanna be part of a pile of corpses, Barry? I sure don’t, so get back to shooting those… <i>things</i>!”</p>
            <p>Schmidt replied “Oh, I could’ve finished reloading a while ago if you didn’t start yelling at me in the middle of a battle, Rob. We’re in a battle to the death and you start complaining about my jokes!”</p>
            <p>“Well now would be a good time for your amazing tide turning sacrifice! If you wait too long---”</p>
            <p>“Boys,” Gladisch intervened, “get back to shooting before you get us all killed.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt and the other soldier, Rob, returned their attention to their guns. Sauer asked “Schmidt, do you know what those things are? Is there any information we could use to better fight them?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know, this wasn’t exactly what---”</p>
            <p>“Watch out, sir!” Rob shouted, taking a step towards Sauer.</p>
            <p>Beside Sauer on the other side of the defences, one of the creatures had approached undetected and lashed out towards him while he spoke with Schmidt. Before he saw the creature, he could smell it. It produced a sickly, sour stench, like rotting fruit. As he turned toward the threat, Sauer noticed that the clumps of the creature’s shell were small, thumb sized orbs, with each orb surrounded by a small amount of sickly white liquid. The creature was shaped like a human, with two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head, though where its facial features should have been was completely flat. Despite the distance between them, Sauer could feel heat radiating from the creature.</p>
            <p>The creature reared back, then lashed out both of its arms towards Sauer over the defences. Rob knocked Sauer onto the ground just before the creature was able to attack him.</p>
            <p>The creature reared back again, preparing to lash at Schmidt. Before it was able to attack, Gladisch punched the creature square in the chest, knocking it to the ground on the other side of the defences. There was a sickly squelching sound as it fell. “We should go. Now.” Gladisch’s voice was laced with fear.</p>
            <p>“That was impressive, ma’am,” Rob said, moving off of Sauer.</p>
            <p>“Not the time, boy,” Gladisch said.</p>
            <p>“Not now, Rob,” Schmidt said at the same time.</p>
            <p>As Sauer got to his feet, he glanced around the battlefield, noticing just how close the creatures had gotten. Most of the soldiers had already retreated towards Dijon’s walls while Captain Bösch remained, directing the remaining soldiers and trying to rouse the soldiers that were frozen in fear. Rob noticed him as well and shouted “We have to help the captain, those things'll kill them!”</p>
            <p>Gladisch replied “We do not have enough time. They will overrun us if we do not leave now. Sauer was almost killed here.”</p>
            <p>“We can’t just leave Bösch,” Schmidt said.</p>
            <p>“Gladisch is right. We will die if we do not retreat now,” Sauer said.</p>
            <p>Sauer watched as one of the creatures approached a middle aged French villager who was standing near the defences, frozen in fear. He blinked as the creature approached him, his terror finally jolting him back into reality. He turned to run, trying desperately to escape the creature that was now within two meters of him.</p>
            <p>The villager kicked his own leg, knocking himself to the ground as the creature moved towards him.</p>
            <p>He shuffled quickly onto his back, but the creature was upon him in a second. “I’m sorry, Cateline!” he screamed in French as the creature forced his head against the ground, kneeling over his body to prevent his escape. From the creature’s neck, a clump of its shell began to fall slowly towards the soldier’s face.</p>
            <p>The clump of shell did not separate from the creature, instead moving slowly and steadily towards the man’s mouth like a third arm. The man’s mouth was open wide in a continuous, terrified scream.</p>
            <p>The clump of the creature’s shell entered his mouth.</p>
            <p>The creature forced its shell deeper into the villager’s throat, suffocating him.</p>
            <p>Sauer watched in horror as the man’s screams were muffled, turning to desperate gasps as he lost the ability to breathe. The clump of shell finally separated itself from the creature’s neck as it began to get back up.</p>
            <p>The villager, finally freed, clawed at his neck and mouth as though trying to remove the clump of the creature’s shell from his throat, writhing in pain on the ground as he slowly suffocated.</p>
            <p>It had taken less than thirty seconds for the creature to obstruct the soldier’s throat, condemning him to death by suffocation.</p>
            <p>The creature turned toward Sauer, the blank slate where its face should have been boring into Sauer.</p>
            <p>It took a step towards him.</p>
            <p>“Mr. Sauer, sir!” Rob called from ahead. The remaining soldiers, including Captain Bösch, were retreating towards the safety of Dijon. “If you don’t wanna die, you should hurry up!”</p>
            <p>Sauer took one last glance toward the creature that killed the villager.</p>
            <p>It had already covered half of the distance between them.</p>
            <p>Sauer turned and ran.</p>
            <p>Though the others were more than fifty meters away from him, Sauer caught up quickly. Between heavy breaths, he asked “What, exactly, are those creatures?”</p>
            <p>“I dunno, sir,” Rob was barely able to wheeze out as he ran. “I don’t know what I was expecting, but it sure as <i>hell</i> was not that.”</p>
            <p>“Sauer, do you think those could really be the result of the disease?” Gladisch asked. Though she was running the fastest out of the group, she was not out of breath.</p>
            <p>“I assume they must be, though I have no idea how those creatures could be a product of any kind of disease that I have ever seen.”</p>
            <p>“Barry, you said you knew what those things were, right?” Rob asked.</p>
            <p>“I…” Schmidt began. His face was hard, though Sauer could hear fear cracking through his voice. “My original theory was that they were the dead that were born again to serve some kind of purpose. I thought maybe they would have had some kind of master that they served. But… I never actually expected any of this to happen, you know? Those things aren’t dead, they’re something else. Maybe they take over the corpses, and that’s why they look like people, but they’re not human, dead or alive. Maybe they do serve a master somewhere that gives them orders, but I have no idea, honestly, I’m just grasping at straws here.”</p>
            <p>“What makes you think they serve a master?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“Well, those monsters are clearly intelligent. They have a strategy, and it worked. We lost at least two dozen men already, and they haven’t lost any…”</p>
            <p>“What strategy are you talking about?”</p>
            <p>“Well, they chose to attack us at dawn...”</p>
            <p>“Is dawn, specifically, important? What was stopping them from attacking us at night with less warning? At night we would be at more of a disadvantage.”</p>
            <p>“They chose to attack at dawn because of the sun. They were using the shadows to hide in and confuse us. I don’t know why they didn’t just attack us at night though, we would’ve been at a worse disadvantage if they did that.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe…” Rob began, “they were just asleep?”</p>
            <p>“That’s dumb Rob,” Schmidt said.</p>
            <p>“No,” Gladisch said, “he might be on to something. We can’t discredit any theories yet; we know nothing.”</p>
            <p>“I do not think they have eyes,” Sauer said, “maybe it was just a coincidence that they attacked at dawn, and it has nothing to do with a strategy.”</p>
            <p>Rob seemed even more frightened than he was before. “If they don’t have eyes, sir, how were they able to attack us like that? If they can’t see, shouldn’t they have not known where we were? And they were going in and out of the shadows, too, shouldn’t they need eyes to do that?”</p>
            <p>“My shot…” Schmidt mumbled. “Maybe they heard my musket shot. And then everyone started panicking, and they just moved towards the sound. Them using the shadows is a good point, though. How would they be able to do that if they couldn’t see?”</p>
            <p>“That is an interesting theory, but they also did not have any ears either,” Sauer said. “Maybe they have some other senses that we do not know about that allow them to see the shadows. I have not seen anything like that before. But Gladisch is right, we should not compare them to anything we know or discredit any theories.”</p>
            <p>“That’s great and all, sir,” Rob’s voice cracked as he spoke, “but how are we supposed to kill them if we don’t even know how they see?”</p>
            <p>“We can not,” Gladisch replied.</p>
            <p>“Wow, great help ma’am,” Rob mumbled.</p>
            <p>They continued to run towards Dijon, their heavy breathing filling the silence. At one point, Rob began to slow down, but Schmidt shouted “You can’t die first, Rob, remember?” and he eventually caught back up.</p>
            <p>Every few minutes, Sauer would glance behind him. If the creatures were still following them, they were doing an excellent job hiding themselves. The sun had risen as they approached Dijon, and Sauer saw that the soldiers that had already returned were arming canons on the top of the wall, aiming them to the west. The gate was still open, but it was guarded by a large group of soldiers, as well as two canons in the middle of the main street. They were motioning for people to get inside.</p>
            <p>Sauer’s group entered the relative safety of the city. Only a few other stragglers came through the gate after them.</p>
            <p>Eventually, the gates were closed.</p>
            <p>Captain Bösch was exclaiming words of encouragement to the soldiers, but Sauer was not listening. He was too busy reviewing his notes.</p>
