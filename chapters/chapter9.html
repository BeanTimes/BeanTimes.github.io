            <div id="div-line-short"></div>

            <p>Sauer thought the scene would be beautiful on a normal day. Behind him, the sun rose steadily. To the south, the Ouche river rambled peacefully through the French countryside. Next to him, his colleagues Wagner and Gladisch stood, terrified of what was going on merely a hundred meters in front of them.</p>
            <p>The soldiers were silent as the first shot was fired.</p>
            <p>They remained silent for a moment, watching as the dead body of an Empire scout was seemingly reanimated by a black mass that ran into the shadow of a tree. They finally began to move again when more black creatures began to emerge from the forest, moving steadily towards them.</p>
            <p>Sauer, Wagner, and Gladisch could not see what was going on, their view blocked by the small army of soldiers and villagers. And, hearing the reactions of the two hundred heavily armed soldiers, they were terrified of whatever was arriving from the west.</p>
            <p>The sound of musket fire began to ring through the countryside, followed by soldiers shouting over each other. Some retreated towards the safety of the village walls, others stood motionless in fear, while others still began to attack the approaching creatures. Wagner was shaking, his teeth clattering together loudly, while Gladisch frowned, looking towards the commotion as if the noise was only a mild inconvenience. Sauer had absolutely no idea what was happening, and stood confused as the commotion transpired around him.</p>
            <p>A booming voice rang out with the practiced confidence of a man worthy of the title captain. “HOLD YOUR POSITION, MEN. THE ENEMY WILL NOT MOVE PAST US. WE ARE THE ONLY THING BETWEEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF DIJON AND THOSE MONSTERS. WE WILL NOT LET THEM BE HARMED.”</p>
            <p>Sauer could feel his journal and quill weighing his breast pocket down slightly. He knew what he was going to do. What he had to do. “I need to see what’s going on. I have to document this.”</p>
            <p>“How do you plan to do that.” Gladisch asked. Her voice had an unusual edge to it, despite her stern face.</p>
            <p>Though he was shaking violently, Wagner was able to stutter out “Are you insane? You’re going to die! Whatever’s attacking us is going to kill you, kill everyone here! We should be defending within the town walls!”</p>
            <p>“I would rather die documenting our enemy than survive knowing nothing about them.” Sauer replied.</p>
            <p>“This isn’t the time to be philosophical, Thomas Sauer! You are going to <i>die</i>! What good will knowing bring you if you’re dead?” Wagner stuttered.</p>
            <p>“I agree with Sauer. We were hired to do this. We have to at least try.” Gladisch decided.</p>
            <p>“Thank you. Now, we should get moving before the situation gets worse.” Sauer said as he and Gladisch began to move towards the defences.</p>
            <p>Wagner called something toward Sauer as he moved away, but it was drowned out by the sound of gunfire and the voices of the soldiers. As they approached the improvised defences, Sauer could tell that there was very little time before the soldiers were overrun. He began to regret his decision, but his curiosity would not let him turn back now. Not when he was so close to finding out what, exactly, they were fighting.</p>
            <p>A few hundred meters in front of the defences was a small group of trees that gradually turned into a forest. The rising sun cast long shadows on the ground under the trees. Sauer watched as dark creatures moved between the shadows, moving steadily towards the soldiers. Though Sauer could tell that they were not human, in the poor early morning light he could not determine an exact reason why. Perhaps it was the way that they moved, or the dark, brownish red outer shell which looked like dried blood that covered the creatures. The shell seemed to be moving over their eerily human bodies, writhing like a swarm of insects on a corpse. Every so often, small clumps of the creature’s shells dripped slowly to the ground.</p>
            <p>Though some of the creatures had been shot, they continued to move forward steadily with terrifying agility. The creatures would shamble behind a tree and hide in the shadows, allowing another creature to exit a different tree’s shadow moving the opposite direction, confusing the soldiers.</p>
            <p>Though they were always moving eastward.</p>
            <p>“They… seem so coordinated...” Sauer breathed to himself, stunned. He began to write notes in his journal.</p>
            <p>“It does seem that way.” Gladisch responded, standing next to Sauer. He jumped, not realizing she was that close to him.</p>
            <p>“Do you see that shell?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“Yes. It seems to be protecting them; when they are shot, a clump of their shell falls.” Sure enough, Sauer watched as a soldier shot a bullet in the shoulder of a monster, which left behind a steaming, fist sized clump of shell. He added that to his notes.</p>
            <p>“Can these creatures be killed with guns? Can they even die?” Sauer asked himself, though he knew Gladisch would respond anyway.</p>
            <p>“I do not know.” Gladisch replied.</p>
            <p>Sauer had only been at the defences for a minute at most, but he already felt that he should be retreating towards the safety of Dijon’s walls. The creatures had made steady progress towards their defences, barely deterred by the constant musket fire from the soldiers. Sauer presumed that the fallen logs would do very little to stop the creatures if guns had no effect on them.</p>
            <p>Quickly, Sauer looked to his right down the line of soldiers that had stayed to fight the monsters. He knew Captain Bösch was somewhere to his right since he could hear him trying to keep order within his company. The company was not listening. However, as Sauer glanced to his right, he noticed a familiar soldier. The horrified face of Barnabas Schmidt looked around frantically as he reloaded his musket.</p>
            <p>When his nervous eyes landed on Sauer, Schmidt said “I told you so.” Then, he laughed a nervous laugh, as though he was trying to ease his tension with a joke.</p>
            <p>Sauer was not in the mood for jokes.</p>
            <p>Before he could release his anxiety by yelling at Schmidt, the soldier next to Schmidt yelled “God <i>damn</i> it Barry, this isn’t the time for telling us you told us so! Or did you think you had to do it before we became a pile of corpses, because we’re getting dangerously close to becoming that. Do you wanna be part of a pile of corpses, Barry? I sure don’t, so get back to shooting those… things!”</p>
            <p>Schmidt replied “Oh, I could’ve finished reloading a while ago if you didn’t start nagging me in the middle of a battle, Rob. We’re in a battle to the death and you start complaining about my jokes!”</p>
            <p>“Well now would be a good time for your amazing tide turning sacrifice! If you wait too long---”</p>
            <p>“Boys.” Gladisch intervened, her voice hard. “Get back to shooting before you get us all killed.”</p>
            <p>Schmidt and the other soldier, Rob, stopped talking, returning their attention to reloading their guns. Sauer asked “Schmidt, was it not? Do you know where Captain Bösch is? We need him to give the order to retreat. Immediately. We will not be able to hold our position.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. Whoever called him was that direction,” Schmidt replied, motioning behind him towards the northern end of the defences, “but I don’t know if he moved somewhere else since he was called. And I think it’s kind of obvious that we should retreat, don’t you? Bösch isn’t an idiot, he’ll---”</p>
            <p>From the northern end of the defences, Bösch’s booming voice rang out “MEN, RETREAT TO THE WALLS OF DIJON. THE ENEMY WILL OVERWHELM US IF WE DO NOT RETREAT. I REPEAT, THIS IS A STRATEGIC RETREAT TO THE WALLS OF DIJON.”</p>
            <p>Beside Sauer on the other side of the defences, one of the creatures had approached undetected and lashed out towards him, his attention focussed on Bösch’s orders.. Before he saw the creature, he could smell it. It produced a sickly, sour stench, like rotting fruit. As he turned toward the threat, Sauer noticed that the clumps of the creature’s shell were small, thumb sized orbs, with each orb surrounded by a small amount of sickly white liquid. The creature was shaped like a human, with two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head, though where its facial features should have been was completely flat.</p>
            <p>The creature reared back, then lashed out both of its arms towards Sauer in a hugging motion. Sauer ducked in time for the creature’s arms to barely brush the top of his head. He could feel an uncomfortable heat radiating from the creature.</p>
            <p>It reared back again, preparing to slash out at one of the other three humans in front of it. At the same time, Gladisch reared back much quicker and punched it square in the chest. The creature, not anticipating an attack, fell backwards. There was a sickly squelching sound. “We should go. Now.” Gladisch said with an urgency that Sauer had never heard from her. He even heard a hint of fear in her voice.</p>
            <p>“That was impressive, ma’am.” Rob said.</p>
            <p>Gladisch said “Not the time, boy.” and Schmidt said “Not now, Rob.” at the same time.</p>
            <p>Sauer looked around, and saw that most of the soldiers had begun to retreat towards the safety of the city walls. Some individual soldiers still stood scattered around the battlefield, staring mouths agape towards the monsters, frozen in fear. Rob noticed them too, and shouted “We have to help them, those things'll kill them!”</p>
            <p>Gladisch replied. “We do not have enough time. They will overrun us if we do not leave now.” More creatures were approaching the defences, now that the attacks from the soldiers had ceased. One of the creatures approached a soldier who was standing near the defences. The soldier blinked as the creature moved towards him, his terror finally jolting him back into reality. He turned and ran, his musket still in hand and angled towards the ground, trying desperately to escape the creature that was now within two meters of him.</p>
            <p>The muzzle of the soldier’s musket fell into the ground as he ran, pushing the butt of the gun hard into his gut. He collapsed in pain as the creature steadily moved towards him.</p>
            <p>The soldier shuffled quickly onto his back. The creature was upon him in a second. He began to scream as the creature forced his head against the ground, kneeling over the soldier’s body to prevent his escape. From the creature’s neck, a clump of its shell began to drip slowly towards the soldier’s face.</p>
            <p>The clump of shell did not separate from the creature, instead moving slowly and steadily towards the soldier’s mouth like a third hand. The soldier’s mouth was open wide in a continuous, terrified scream.</p>
            <p>The clump of the creature’s shell entered the soldier’s mouth.</p>
            <p>It did not stop, forcing its way deep into the soldier’s throat, suffocating him.</p>
            <p>Sauer watched in horror as the soldier’s screams were slowly muffled, turning to desperate gasps as he lost the ability to breathe. The clump of shell finally separated itself from the creature’s neck as it began to get back up.</p>
            <p>The soldier was finally freed, his hands clawing at his neck and mouth as though trying to remove the clump of the creature’s shell from his throat, writhing in pain on the ground as he slowly suffocated.</p>
            <p>It had taken less than thirty seconds for the creature to obstruct the soldier’s throat, condemning him to death by suffocation.</p>
            <p>The creature turned toward Sauer, the blank slate where the face should have been boring into Sauer.</p>
            <p>It began to move towards him.</p>
            <p>“Sauer!” Schmidt called from ahead. The others were already retreating towards the safety of Dijon. “If you don’t want to die, you should hurry up!”</p>
            <p>Sauer took one last glance toward the creature that killed the soldier. It was already halfway between them. Sauer turned and ran.</p>
            <p>Though the others were more than fifty meters away from him, Sauer caught up quickly. Between heavy breaths, he asked “What, exactly, are those creatures?”</p>
            <p>“I dunno, sir,” Rob was barely able to wheeze out as he ran, “I don’t know what I was expecting, but it sure as <i>hell</i> was not that.”</p>
            <p>“Sauer, do you think those are the result of the disease?” Gladisch asked. Though she was running the fastest out of the group, she did not seem to be out of breath.</p>
            <p>“I assume so. Though I have no idea how those creatures could be a product of any kind of disease that I have ever seen.”</p>
            <p>“Barry, you said you knew what those things were, right?” Rob asked.</p>
            <p>“I…” Schmidt began. His face was hard, though Sauer could hear fear cracking through his voice. “My original theory was that they were the dead that were born again to serve some kind of purpose. I thought maybe they had some kind of master that they served, you know? But those things aren’t the dead, they’re something else. Maybe they take over the corpses, and that’s why they look like people? Maybe they do serve a master somewhere that gives them orders? I have no idea, honestly, I’m just grasping at straws here.”</p>
            <p>“What makes you think they serve a master?” Sauer asked.</p>
            <p>“I already told you, they’re clearly intelligent. They have a strategy, and it worked. We lost at least ten men already, and they haven’t lost any… soldiers, I guess.”</p>
            <p>“What strategy do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“They had a strategy to take over the Iberian peninsula, that’s why we haven’t heard anything from farther west than Dijon in months. They’ve been taking over people, or at least their corpses, and growing their numbers for months, maybe even since Paris had that outbreak a few years ago. It’s like they’re assimilating an occupied area’s army into your own. And then they chose to attack us at dawn.”</p>
            <p>“Is dawn, specifically, important? What was stopping them from attacking us at night with less warning? At night we would be at more of a disadvantage.”</p>
            <p>“Well, they chose to attack at dawn because of the sun, I think. They were using the shadows to hide and try and confuse us. And I don’t know why they didn’t just attack us at night, we would’ve been at a worse disadvantage if they did that.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe…” Rob began. “They were just asleep?”</p>
            <p>“That’s dumb Rob.” Schmidt said.</p>
            <p>“No.” Gladisch said. “He might be on to something. We can’t discredit any theories yet; we know nothing.”</p>
            <p>“I do not think they have eyes,” Sauer said, “maybe it was just a coincidence that they attacked at dawn, and it has nothing to do with a strategy.”</p>
            <p>Rob seemed even more frightened than he was before. “If they don’t have eyes, sir, how were they able to attack us like that? If they can’t see, shouldn’t they have not known where we were? And they were going in and out of the shadows, too, shouldn’t they need eyes to do that?”</p>
            <p>“My shot…” Schmidt mumbled. “Maybe they heard my musket shot. And then everyone started panicking, and just moved towards the sound. Them using the shadows is a good point, though. How would they be able to do that if they couldn’t see?”</p>
            <p>“That is an interesting theory, but they also did not have any visible ears.” Sauer said. “Maybe they have some other senses that we do not know about that allow them to see the shadows. I have not seen anything like that before. But Gladisch is right, we should not compare them to anything we know or discredit any theories.”</p>
            <p>“That’s great and all, sir,” Rob’s voice cracked as he spoke, “but how are we supposed to kill them if we don’t even know how they even see?”</p>
            <p>“We can not.” Gladisch replied.</p>
            <p>“Wow, great help ma’am.” Rob mumbled.</p>
            <p>They continued to run towards Dijon, their heavy breathing filling the silence. At one point, Rob began to slow down, but Schmidt shouted “You can’t die first, Rob, remember?” and he eventually caught back up to the others.</p>
            <p>Every few minutes, Sauer would glance behind him. If the creatures were still following them, it was doing an excellent job hiding themselves. The sun had risen as they approached Dijon, and Sauer saw that the soldiers that had already returned were arming canons on the top of the wall, aiming them to the west. The gate was still open, but it was guarded by a large group of soldiers, as well as two canons in the middle of the main street. They were motioning for people to get inside.</p>
            <p>Sauer’s group entered the relative safety of the city.</p>
            <p>A few other stragglers came through the gate after them.</p>
            <p>And eventually, the gates were closed.</p>
            <p>Captain Bösch was exclaiming words of encouragement to the soldiers, but Sauer was not listening. He was too busy reviewing his notes.</p>
